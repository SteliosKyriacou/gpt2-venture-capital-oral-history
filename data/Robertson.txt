Interviewer: It is April 22, 2010, and this is an interview with Sanford—better known asSandy—Robertson. I want to start back with where you were born, a little bitabout your family and your education. Robertson: All right. Well, I was born in Chicago, grew up in the suburbs of Chicago. Myfather [Donald Robertson] was kind of a serial entrepreneur, so geneticallymaybe I get some of this stuff. He had a candy company and then a veryfamous restaurant [Hearthstone House, Winnetka, IL], and then sold that. Hethen had a whole series of little companies. He always said, you will never behappy till you have your own firm. And I said, “Well, Dad, I’ll be aninvestment banker, and I won’t be just an employee. If I make it, I’ll be apartner of that firm.” He said, “Well, we’ll see how that is.” Well, I was apartner of Smith Barney, and I called him, and he was a week or so away fromhis eightieth birthday. I said, “Dad, I’ve always done what you’ve alwayswanted me to do. I’ve started my own firm.” He said, “Oh, that’s good. Istarted a new company this week myself.” [laughter] So I think I come by thisa little bit genetically.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, it sounds that way. Was there a lot of conversation around the dinnertable about what he was doing with his various businesses? Robertson: Yes. I was born fairly late in his life. In the 1920’s, he was quite successful inhis first company, and he helped several other friends found companies. Itwasn’t called venture capital in those days. He did it all on a loan basis topeople.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: He devised that system on his own? Robertson: He just felt strongly that people should, if they could, be working forthemselves and have their own business.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What happened during the Depression? Robertson: In the twenties he had a hand-dipped candy business, like those white storesthat are out there now.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: See’s.  Robertson: Like See’s Candies. He had seventeen stores. When the Depression camealong, that was a very postponable expense. He was able to unwind those,didn’t have to take it into bankruptcy, got out of every lease, and wound thething down, of which he was proud that it didn’t go into[bankruptcy].<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So he was clever as well. Robertson: I think he was pretty clever, yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Are you an only child? Robertson: I am.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You went to high school in the Chicago area? Robertson: I went to a very high-powered high school called New Trier, with abouttwenty-five hundred students at the time. It still continues to be a very toughhigh school and a very great education.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were you beginning to get interested in anything in particular? Robertson: My father’s next business was a major restaurant. Duncan Hines, who was theMichelin Guide of the time, had rated it one of the five best restaurants in thecountry. It was large, and so I worked in that and was close to my father’swork. I could see it and worked in it, and so I always thought— I happened tododge a bullet, because he sold it just before I went to college, so I didn’t haveto go to the Cornell Hotel School and come back and run it. But I could seehow hard he worked and what that produced and saw how a business was runat quite an early age. I probably thought I always wanted to be a businessman.I had one grandfather who was a doctor. I considered that for a while. Onegrandfather was a lawyer, and that didn’t appeal to me. But business wasalways in the forefront of my thinking.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did that mean any special emphasis, such as more math? I guess at the highschool level it’s a little hard to figure out what you take for business. Robertson: I took the normal pre-college courses, the college advanced courses, and yes, Itook quite a bit of math, but nothing out of the ordinary. It was pretty well setwith what you had to take in high school. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And then the next step was the University of Michigan? Robertson: The University of Michigan.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why Michigan? Robertson: Well, I went to a very, very large high school, and so I thought the next stepup would be to be at something larger. I toured the eastern schools andparticularly liked Williams and Amherst, which were smaller, but then Ithough, gee, that’s a step down in size. A friend had gone to Michigan acouple of years ahead of me and was really liking it. You could go anydirection there. So that’s not unlike Berkeley. In fact, when I go to Berkeley itreminds me of Ann Arbor.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is it Michigan that has the residential colleges? Robertson: They’ve just started that in recent years.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh, I see. So that wasn’t what you experienced, obviously. Robertson: No. You were just thrown in the lake and you had to swim.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What happened in those four years? Robertson: Well, I knew again that I probably wanted to go to business school. One otherfact on Michigan that led me there is you could get an MBA in a total of fiveyears rather than six. By this time the Korean War was on, and it looked prettyattractive to do that.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Attractive so you avoided the draft. Robertson: Well, you were going to get drafted when you got out. Something most peopledon’t remember was in the Korean War you took a national exam, and if youscored seventy on it—I don’t know what that number really means—youcould stay in school through your undergraduate degree. If you got seventyfive, you could go to graduate school before being drafted.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I’d never heard that.  Robertson: So I was able to go through graduate school and thought about goingsomewhere else for business school. But it was attractive to save that extrayear, because you had to have at least two years in the army or go in someofficer program.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did that mean that, in your senior year or whenever, you could start to takebusiness courses? Robertson: That’s exactly right, yes. You kind of overlapped it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Looking back at your business school experience, has it helped in what youdid thereafter? Robertson: Yes. Business school was very good. It gives you all the techniques. I don’tthink business school is for everybody. We have people here in the firm thatare doing so well, and they understand business so well that sometimes itwould be a waste of two years for them to go and get an MBA.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Are these people who have run business of their own? Is that how they gettheir experience? Robertson: In one case, yes. One guy ran a business all the way though college and sold itfor quite a bit to another student. So he was a natural athlete in the world ofbusiness.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is that coming to be a more general perception? That an MBA isn’t absolutelyde rigueur? Robertson: Well, I think it’s still important for most people to have, and you really learnthe techniques of creating a business.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was the business school at Michigan known for a certain orientation asopposed to, say, the Sloan School of Management or Harvard or whatever youwant to take as an example? Robertson: At that time it was known for finance and particularly for accounting. It hadthe best accounting department in the country.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did that resonate with you?  Robertson: I did the basic things in accounting, but I didn’t get into the details. I wasmore finance.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And that you liked. Robertson: I loved that, yes, right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: We’re moving fast, I know, over significant time, but is there anything elseyou want to say about those five years at Michigan? Robertson: At a school like that, you’re really on your own. It’s like being out in the realworld. And I always felt that that was an advantage. You really had to makeall the decisions yourself. There was no—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: No advisors. Robertson: Well, technically, I guess, there was an advisor, but he probably had ahundred people he had to talk to. But you really were on your own. And ittaught you to be very independent and make your own decisions.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did that have the possible downside of not having a close relationship withyour professors? Robertson: No, that did happen, that you could have a close relationship with yourprofessor.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was there anybody that you would consider a mentor? Robertson: There were a couple of them. One was a finance professor who really got meinterested in corporate finance, and another was an economics professor, andanother one was the dean emeritus who taught a comparative economicscourse. They were all people you really remember and think back on.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, before we leave Michigan, you mentioned off-tape that you’d had aMichigan group here yesterday. So obviously you maintain the ties. In whatway?  Robertson: Well, this whole room yesterday was filled with the University of Michiganinvestment committee and the investment staff. I’ve been on the investmentcommittee for about fifteen years, and we have a very active, very goodinvestment committee, and about an $8 billion endowment.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And it’s doing all right, considering the downturn? Robertson: It’s doing very well.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, that’s an exception to a lot of stories. Robertson: We had our advisor, Cambridge Associates, here and they rank all theseschools on a code basis. But you can figure out by size who it is. And we havedone extremely well versus Harvard and Yale.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, you read about that. Robertson: Just before this downturn, we ranked second to Harvard one year, second toYale one year, but on a blended basis we ranked first over the two years.We’ve had a good investment manager, which is the key to that. We’ve gotseven other guys on this committee and one woman, who are phenomenal.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do committee members see an approach the same way? Robertson: No, we all come from different backgrounds. There’s a venture capitalist andan M&A [mergers & acquisitions] expert, a pension fund manager, one guyfrom Goldman Sachs, one from Bain [& Company] bringing in more of amanagement consulting view toward things, and it’s a very outspoken group.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It must be fun! Robertson: It is a lot of fun, yes, right. It’s a way to contribute to the university too.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That’s after many years too. That’s quite a contribution on your part. All right,the next step is the navy. So tell me about that. Robertson: Well, the Korean War was on, and when you graduated then you were eligiblefor the draft, which would have been two years in the army. But there was a navy program to become a naval officer that was very popular. You had tostay in for three years—three years after going through Officer CandidateSchool. That program was highly desirable, and there were 450 people in ourclass out of twenty thousand that applied. It was the greatest bunch of guysI’ve ever been around in my life—really, really wonderful guys.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What were the criteria for entry? Was it all about grade point average? Robertson: Well, I guess you took an exam, but everybody there had an MBA, a lawdegree, or a master’s in engineering. So they might have looked at theeducation. With only five years to get an MBA [1954], I was the mostundereducated, because most of the people had six years to get their [MBA]—or seven years for law school. But it was a terrific bunch of guys, and they’veall thrived since then. One’s been partner at Morgan Stanley, one’s a partnerof CS [Credit Suisse] First Boston, another one head of a law firm in Hartford,another one head of a New York law firm. I’m still in touch with a half dozenof them—really, really terrific group of guys.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: To what purpose was the navy going to use this group? Robertson: Well, most of us were becoming supply officers—the MBAs and the lawyers.The master’s in engineering guys went on to specialized engineeringfunctions, and a couple of people went into navy intelligence. But it was aprogram, this OCS [Officer Candidate School], where they normally washedout about 30 percent of the people, and then you spent the rest of the time asan enlisted man if you washed out. They couldn’t flunk anybody out of thisgroup, and they didn’t know what they had. So one week they just canceled allthe classes and gave us psychological tests and intelligence tests all day long,which became a real advantage later on looking for a job. If the company gaveyou an intelligence test or a psychological test, you’d seen the questionsbefore! [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What did you end up doing? Robertson: I went to Japan. I had a very good experience in the navy. First I went toGuam and I was a supply officer. It was a cargo-handling battalion, which inwartime would go in after the amphibious troops. But we had differentpeacetime functions. There were thirteen officers and five hundred men, andthen the Korean War by then had ended. So they cut it back to three officersand a hundred men and sent us to Japan. Well, I became the number twoofficer, the executive officer, in this scenario, which meant that I was theoperating person of the group. I learned more, frankly, about running mybusiness later in life by running that navy operation than I did in business school, because it was really practical, hands-on experience, getting people towork for you, giving an order, working for someone. And when the captain,the number one guy, had to go on emergency leave, I actually had commandof a naval unit for about a month.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How old were you at that point? Robertson: I was twenty-five. So that was a great experience after business school. Ialways thought I was going to waste my time going in the service for a while.However, I got a lot more out of those three years in the navy than I couldhave as a trainee at some big corporation.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So that was still occupied Japan, wasn’t it? Wasn’t [Douglas] MacArthur stillthere? Robertson: No. It was a little after that, because I was there in ’56 and ’57.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see. An interesting time nonetheless. Robertson: It was a great time to be there, yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Then you went to American Hospital Supply Corporation for one year [1958]. Robertson: Yes, when I got out of the navy I thought I either wanted to go to a mediumsize growing corporation or get in the investment world. And AmericanHospital Supply, the year I joined them, went from $65 million in sales to$100. It later became a billion dollar company, more than a billion dollarcompany, and it was a very growing, interesting company.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And that’s what attracted you? The growth of it? Robertson: That’s what attracted me, but I also found out that I really missed theinvestment world. It was in Evanston, Illinois, near Northwestern University,and at the end of the day I’d go down to their financial library and look upstocks and think about securities, and I thought I should make my avocationand my vocation coincide. So I quit and joined Smith Barney [1959-1969].<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And of course the obvious question is why Smith Barney?  Robertson: Well, they were the one that offered me a job! [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That’s a good reason. Did that mean Wall Street? Where did you go? Robertson: Well, then I went to New York for a year to work for Smith Barney, through avery extensive, wonderful training program that they had.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was it a general training program? Or were they slotting you towards a certainaspect of the business? Robertson: It was a general training program, and they actually put you to work in eachdepartment. I worked on the then second largest offering, of A&P. How thenumbers have changed. It was an $84 million offering which would hardly getanybody’s attention today. The only one that had been larger had been Ford,which had had a $100 million offering.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And were you getting more and more convinced that the investment side ofthings was where your interest lay? Robertson: Oh, I loved it even as the most junior person around. It was wonderful.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now did that training serve you well later on? Robertson: Very much so, oh yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So a year in the training program, in New York. Did you have a family yet? Robertson: I did. I had a wife and one daughter at the time. I almost stayed in New York,but I had been hired to go back to Chicago, and I decided to go back there.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: With Smith Barney. Robertson: With Smith Barney.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And why? Robertson: They were giving me some responsibilities that I thought were very good. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were they responsibilities above and beyond the time you’d been with thefirm? You’d only been there a year. Robertson: I’d only been there a year, but in the first year it was all in New York in atraining program. But in Chicago they were going to give me theresponsibility of covering Iowa and Nebraska for them, and I could be outthere on my own.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was that unusual? Would people emerging from a year’s training programusually have been given something as responsible? Robertson: One would usually be behind somebody else. And I was briefly. But this guysaid he was going to be promoted and I’d have it all to myself.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And of course you loved that. Robertson: You could call on all the insurance companies, and the industrial companiesout there. Also, Warren Buffet and the investment managers.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How was Smith Barney as your umbrella? I should be more direct because Iwas hoping to get a flavor for investment banking on the East Coast, asopposed to what’s going to happen on the West Coast. So I guess my questionshould be, are you getting a feeling for the culture of investment banking? Isthat what you’re doing at Smith Barney? Robertson: Yes. It was the East Coast culture at Smith Barney.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Please expand on that. Robertson: Well, they were looking at traditional companies, both in the East and inChicago. They weren’t looking at growth companies. There weren’t theentrepreneurially financed companies to speak of.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And no high-tech. Robertson: No high-tech. There were some very good companies. The A.C. NielsenCompany was a company we did a lot of work for. And Nielsen then, I think,was the second largest user of computers in the country, using all this data.They were known for their television rating thing. But really what they did was measure how fast soap and shampoo and goods moved off the shelves inthe supermarket. Nielsen had been started by one man. By then it had been inbusiness maybe twenty years, so it wasn’t a new startup sort of thing. Butmost of the companies, at one point, had been entrepreneurially financed.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And at this point you didn’t know of any other way of doing it, did you? Robertson: No, that’s right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So you were not questioning why Smith Barney was sticking with relativelyconservative, established companies. Are those adjectives right? Robertson: That’s absolutely correct. Then when I got to the West Coast, I couldn’t trainthem otherwise. That was one of the reasons I spun off and did my own firm.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, are we there? No—I have 1959 to 1969 at Smith Barney, so that’s tenyears—that’s longer than you’ve been anywhere else. Robertson: By 1965 I had become the assistant manager of the Chicago office, andovernight they’d fired the head of the San Francisco office. I got called in andthey said, did I want to go out to San Francisco. I think they’d thought of mebecause the firm had no office in Los Angeles at the time, and Los Angeleshad just passed Chicago as the second largest city. So I was kind ofnegotiating with the firm to open up in Los Angeles for them, and they musthave thought of me in relation to California.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And then you would run that office? Robertson: And I would run that office—yes. But that was still being thought about. Theyfired the San Francisco manager, and I went out and on four hours’ notice gotin a plane and came to the West Coast. So then on the West Coast—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But this is still—? Robertson: I was with Smith Barney, so I was running Smith Barney’s office.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: In San Francisco.  Robertson: In San Francisco, but it had responsibilities for all of the West Coast andHawaii.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was that intimidating? Robertson: No. [chuckling] It was fun! There was a lot to be done. There was a lot to bedone.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And did you have a good staff in place? Robertson: Yes and no. I recruited Ken [Kenneth F.] Siebel and Bob [Robert] Colmanfrom other parts of the firm. I’d hired Siebel for Chicago, and he was in NewYork being trained when I came out, and he was the key guy that I reallybrought out. No—the office had to be beefed up a lot. So I recruited severalpeople.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, does that reflect Smith Barney philosophy somewhat? That theemphasis is still on the East Coast, and okay, they’ve got the San Franciscooffice, but they’re not going to put their best people there? Robertson: Well, the fact that they fired my predecessor probably means that they didn’thave the right guy, but it needed to be changed quite a bit.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But the impression I’m getting, and perhaps it’s wrong, is that this was not acenter of real focus for Smith Barney. They were still East Coast-focused? Robertson: Right, and they’d never, ever done a piece of investment banking on the WestCoast. It was strictly a brokerage operation. So in one of the fastest growing,most interesting parts of the country they had a big goose egg.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So Silicon Valley went right over their head? Robertson: They didn’t even know the name. And the name probably wasn’t being evenused then.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, I think the name comes sometime in the seventies. But there was plentygoing on there, name or no name.  Robertson: Well, first they said, “Go call on the Bank of America, call on Chevron, callthe forest products companies, utilities.” I said, “No, the really interestingcompanies out here are Hewlett-Packard and Varian Associates and Ampexand Fairchild Semiconductor.” They said, “Semiconductors—that’s bad stuff.They’ll have a good semiconductor one year, and the next year someone elsehas a better one, and maybe Texas Instruments is better. Don’t worry aboutthose companies.” And I said, “Well, I really think we ought to.” So I wentahead and called on these companies anyway.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now why did you have that mindset? Robertson: Well, I think it’s genetic. My father being a serial entrepreneur, I was reallyinterested in small business and growing businesses. Even the year atAmerican Hospital Supply; it was a very interesting company.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: In what way? Robertson: The year I spent there it was a nice, fast-growing company, almost 50%.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see, but that was a big company. You’re saying because it was really intogrowth that you were catching that idea? Robertson: Growth, a growing company, yes. But one of the first things I did was do aprivate placement for a company called Spectra-Physics, which was theleading laser company in the world, and a very, very fine company. They justdominated— They had 70 percent of the world’s laser market, and it’s how Imet Tom Perkins too. But Spectra-Physics was just the leader in its wholefield, and I got the firm to do a private placement. We placed some privatestock with venture firms.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: When you say a private placement, does that mean Smith Barney funds? Orwere you raising— Robertson: Well, both. It was basically raising it to put in some venture capitalists’ handsin the East. But I got the firm to take a $100,000 piece themselves. I said,“You really ought to do this.” Well, this was a little bit far out for the firm.And when I’d go back for a partners meeting, my partners would say, “Hey,Buck Rogers, how’s our ray gun company going out there?” And I couldn’tteach them that this was a valid thing—that lasers were starting to be used asscanners in supermarkets where you passed the barcode over it; they wereused in technical instruments like interferometers. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But Smith Barney didn’t buy that? They just thought it was a flash in the pan? Robertson: Well, they didn’t really realize, in a way, what they had. Then they turned medown on a financing for Fairchild Semiconductor.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: For the same reason? Robertson: The same reason.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why do we want those semiconductors? Robertson: Yes, and so at that point I thought I’ve got to start my own firm. So KenSiebel was the one who I’d really recruited, and Bob Colman. And we broughtthem in, and the three of us decided to start our own firm [Robertson, Colman,Siebel, Weisel].<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, before we move on past the lasers, I do want you to tell me about theTom Perkins connection. By then he had University Labs, right? Robertson: Well, he had University Labs, and we merged that into Spectra-Physics.Spectra Physics had been making lasers strictly for scientific use—interferometers—and they were doing some barcode scanning, the very earlydays of that. But Tom had started University Labs that originally made a kitfor kids to use in school.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: He didn’t tell me that. I didn’t realize it was for kids. Robertson: Well, that was the original project, and it led to lasers being used inconstruction. What they did was take the laser, and they used it to make a linearound a wall. It would be on a tripod and going around, and then you couldput your ceiling tiles in and get them absolutely straight. If you were digging aditch, a sewer, it had to be maybe dropped three inches every hundred yards toget the flow of the water. Well, that was very difficult to do with a string andtripods and surveying instruments. You could do that with a laser line goingdown that trench. So they were doing things like that with lasers. The thirdthing they did was if you were grading a piece of land and you wanted itabsolutely smooth, you could use the laser, which is a straight point of light,where a string might have sagginess to it or something. They took lasers andused them in very prosaic but very useful ways. So that’s what UniversityLabs did, and we put that into Spectra-Physics. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But Spectra-Physics already had a laser of its own? Robertson: Spectra-Physics was manufacturing them.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh, I see how it went. And University Labs, as the name implies, was inBerkeley. But where is/was Spectra-Physics? Robertson: It was in Mountain View.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: All right. So there we get Silicon Valley, don’t we. Robertson: Yes, and Charles Townes, who had gotten the Nobel Prize for the laser, wason an advisory board for them.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: We have a huge oral history with him, by the way. Robertson: Do you really?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It’s online. Robertson: Oh, well—good! I met him one time. He’s a very, very nice guy. Robertson: Anyway, that’s how I met Tom—through that.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I know from talking to him fairly recently that he made money whenUniversity Labs was sold, of course. He didn’t immediately leave HewlettPackard, but I think the fact that he had money to play with was instrumentalin the idea that he wanted to go into venture capital. Robertson: Yes, it gave him his stake away from Hewlett-Packard, and he was veryimportant to Hewlett-Packard. He was running the computer division. But hehad an entrepreneurial bent, and he was investing in some things other thanjust University Labs, and Hewlett-Packard was very approving of this. Theythought it gave their people more entrepreneurial spirit, and they liked that. Alot of companies wouldn’t let someone do that, but Hewlett-Packardapparently did. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, tell the story, please, about your introduction of Tom Perkins and GeneKleiner. Robertson: Well, when we started our firm, we decided we wanted some limited partners.Number one, for capital, but number two, to help us find business. We hadsome capital partners; we had some General Mills founders who put $100,000in, and a real estate guy, and then Tom Perkins. We thought he was in touchwith the growing companies that we might want to know. It was part of ourRolodex to have a farm system and have people like Tom point us towardcompanies. Eugene Kleiner was another one.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How had you known him? Robertson: Eugene—I don’t think I knew Gene that well. Ken Siebel and I went andcalled on him cold and told him what we were going to do. As a matter offact, we had not met him until we had that meeting.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was he still at Fairchild? Robertson: No, he’d left Fairchild. And he’d done another company that was doingeducational terminals. You could do some interactive learning through theterminals, and he sold that to Raytheon. He had started another company thathad been successful and sold it. But he was a Fairchild founder. He had acouple other companies, but the one that he was known for secondarily, afterFairchild, was this educational company. Ken Siebel and I called on him coldand talked to him, and he committed $100,000 on the spot. He liked what wewere going to do.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was it the high-tech emphasis that caught him? Robertson: Yes, exactly. And we said that we wanted to underwrite high-tech companies.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: When was this? Robertson: That would have been in ’69.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you call it, in investment banking, a fund? Robertson: No, it was not a fund. It was an investment banking firm. So anyway, we had about eight limited partners. Kleiner was one, Perkins wasthe other. They didn’t know each other. I’d had lunch with Tom one day, andhe said, “You know, at some point I want to leave Hewlett-Packard and do aventure fund.” Then I also had lunch with Eugene one day, and he said, “TheHillman family wants to give me a couple of million dollars to do a venturefund.” This is 1972. Brentwood Associates in Los Angeles had been trying fortwo years to raise a $5 million fund, and it had taken them two years. Ihappened to run into them, and they said, “Oh,! We’ve finally got our fundtogether after working on this for two years.” And so I knew there’s probablysome money around. So I said to both Tom and Eugene, “I think maybethere’s a little bit of money around for some venture capital now,” and Iwanted to introduce them to each other. So we met at Rickey’s Hyatt House, which was the place you met forbreakfast in those days. I guess it’s now Buck’s. But in those days it wasRickey’s Hyatt House, and we met at 8:00. The chemistry was wonderful rightfrom the beginning. We finally got kicked out of there about quarter of twelvewhen they wanted to set up the place for lunch. Eugene had the semiconductorworld covered, and Tom had the computer world covered. And theyoverlapped a little bit with their friends and Rolodex. They hadn’t known eachother before, but they really hit it off.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But very different personalities. Robertson: Extremely different personalities.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I unfortunately never had a chance to talk to Gene Kleiner, but just from whatI’ve read— Robertson: Eugene was just a wonderful individual, very quiet, very thoughtful, and areally fine, fine person, just a wonderful human being.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And so he and Tom clicked on a personal level too? Robertson: It was on a personal level too. That was a Thursday morning, and they said,“Well, we’ll get together over the weekend and talk.” And they talked most ofSaturday and most of Sunday and called me on Monday morning and said,“Let’s go raise a fund!” We were going to try for a $10 million fund, and Iguess we must have started raising the money right after Labor Day. By thefirst week in December, we had $8.4 million raised. And it was so tenuous;we thought over Christmas someone might change his mind. Maybe we’dbetter close this thing out at $8.4 million. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was that the economy? I know the early seventies weren’t a great period ingeneral for risky investment. But was that also because people didn’t knowwhat venture capital was? Robertson: Partly. It seemed very risky to people, extremely risky to people. Theeconomy in ’72 had gotten a little bit better. It wasn’t horrible. We’d taken athrough ’72—so till early ’72 we hadn’t done any offerings. There was an IPOmarket a little bit, but it was thought to be very risky, and there was nothingreally developed in this area. And a $5 million fund was a big fund, it was areally huge fund. So we thought we were going to try for 10, and we had 8.4.We thought, boy, over Christmas we might lose a couple of these guys, solet’s close it out. In reality, Kleiner Perkins never spent the full 8.4.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why? Because you couldn’t find good enough deals? Robertson: They couldn’t find enough deals, and then they were about to do Fund II.Then people wanted to put more money into it, and so they did Fund II.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was that pretty quickly after that? Robertson: That one was called Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, rather than Kleiner &Perkins.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So that’s maybe about ’74-’75-ish? Robertson: It was probably ’74-’75, maybe ’74. So out of the $8 million, they probablyput only five or six to work. They were thinking about buying some publicstocks, but the limited partners didn’t give them money to put in public stocks.The limiteds could do that themselves.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Would that be legal to do that? Robertson: Yes, it would. Robertson: But when people put money in venture capital, they want you to put it inventure capital. They don’t want you to buy Intel when it’s cheap, orsomething like that. They can go do that themselves. You can tell them youthink it looks cheap, but they really want the risk/reward ratio of venturecapital. Both Tandem and Genentech came out of that fund. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It was all right, wasn’t it. Robertson: And a couple of others that were probably doubles or something like that,nothing like the multiples on Tandem and Genentech.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now did your firm ride on this success? Robertson: Well, we were the placement agent for them. So we raised the money and thenwe were close to them. When they had a company ready to go public, wehoped that we would have a chance to take it public.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But that wasn’t a hard and fast understanding? Robertson: No, it was just sort of friends, right. And we did take almost all of thempublic. I can’t think of one of the Kleiner & Perkins companies in the earlydays we didn’t take public.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But you were a new company. You’d only been founded since 1969. As yousaid, you had Tandem and Genentech in that first fund. Robertson: Yes, they had it in their first fund.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Maybe it wasn’t obvious yet what a success that fund was going to be. I’mwondering about the interaction between the Kleiner Perkins fund and yourcompany trying to get off the ground. Robertson: Well, we were off the ground by the time we raised the money for them. Weweren’t huge, but we were part of the “four horsemen” at the time who weredoing deals.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And who are the four horsemen? Robertson: Well, it basically was Hambrecht & Quist and ourselves, and [L.F.]Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin, and then Alex Brown [& Sons].<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Are they all on the West Coast? 20 Robertson: Alex Brown was in Baltimore. Then Montgomery [Securities], which our firmbegan—and we spun out—that’s a whole other story, kind of became theother four horsemen and Unterberg, Towbin went away. But there werealways four of us doing these deals.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I’m also interested in what happened when Thom Weisel arrived—fourpartners. How were you four working together? Robertson: Well, what happened—the firm was originally Robertson, Colman & Siebel.And in ’72, we added Weisel. He had been with another firm. And then a yearlater we put his name on the door. It was Robertson, Colman, Siebel & Weiselabout ’73. Ken Siebel retired to become a money manager, which was hisor ’77. And then in 1978, the firm split in two.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And that was unhappy, wasn’t it? Robertson: That was unhappy. The other firm had the New York Stock Exchange seat, soeffectively Robertson, Colman, Siebel & Weisel became MontgomerySecurities. We bought a new seat and started Robertson, Colman, Stephens,later called Robertson Stephens.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And what was the unhappiness? Robertson: Well, Weisel was very difficult to get along with, so we could have goneinternally and had a big fight, and the firm probably would have split apartanyway. So we just quietly resigned at the end of the fiscal year and went ourseparate ways and took the name. We took the name; they took the NYSEseat.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I’ve never heard what it means to buy a seat. Robertson: There’s a market in seats. There was always a bid and ask. And we boughtthat seat very cheaply at about $75,000.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What would it be nowadays? Robertson: Now it’s publicly held, so it is not comparable. We bought the seat for$75,000. It had been over $500,000 in the late sixties, and then it crasheddown to about $75,000. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So you were fortunate. Robertson: We did it with perfect timing. It’s no trouble buying one, but you do have totake some exams, and you have to show that you’re competent, and you’vegot to get approved by the committee. But that’s not difficult to do. If youhaven’t had experience in the business, they might want to put you throughsome training, particularly if you’re going to work on the floor and actuallytrade with specialists. You’ve got to know some technical procedures.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But nobody in your firm intended to do that, did they? Robertson: No. We would have someone else do it for us.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So is this now Robertson Stephens that we’re talking about? Robertson: Now we’re talking about Robertson Stephens.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: 1978 to September 1998 is what I got from your bio. Robertson: That’s right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What to say about Robertson Stephens! There’s so much! [laughter] Well,first of all, who’s Stephens? Robertson: Paul Stephens. He’s a money manager in town. Stephens InvestmentManagement, and he had been with us at Robertson, Colman. He’s a guy Ihired out of Berkeley, as a matter of fact.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So was that a natural for the two of you to be partners? Robertson: Yes. He had worked with Ken Siebel, and when Ken left he kind of took overthat function in the firm. They were close friends, and Siebel’s still a veryclose friend. I’m about to go to his daughter’s wedding in a couple of weeks.But Paul kind of took over that brokerage and money management functionfor us, and that’s what Ken Siebel had been doing.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were there other people that you transferred from the old firm? Or did youhave to start from scratch?  Robertson: No, it was two-thirds/one-third. We kept the people that we wanted.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see, so there wasn’t a huge lag period between the old firm and starting upthe new? Robertson: No, there was about a month in there because wehad to get re-registered withthe SEC and all that sort of thing.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And how did you divide up your clients? Robertson: We were competing for them. Montgomery and Robertson Stephens wereboth after them! [chuckling] We actually had most of the banking clients. Ithink we had all of the banking clients.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now why was that? Robertson: Because investment banking was my function.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: All right, so it was a vote for Sandy Robertson. Robertson: And Weisel was on the trading desk. He covered the institutional clients, andthe institutions deal with everybody. So we took the banking clients, but theystill had the institutional relationships, and so did we.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You took them, but isn’t it more accurate to say they chose to go with you? Robertson: The ones that came with us, yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You couldn’t just say, “You’re coming with us, boys.” [chuckling] Robertson: No, that’s right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I don’t know this area, so I’m asking some naïve questions. Robertson: Everybody we asked to come over came, except one. And he had a prettygood situationwhere he was. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, that’s a pretty good vote of confidence, isn’t it? Robertson: That’s right, yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So this is 1978. Things are getting better in the economy, aren’t they? Robertson: [pause] Yes—that was an okay year. It’s relative to what we’ve seen—thenumbers have changed so dramatically. We’ve not added one zero, but twozeroes in some of these things.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I know that was the year that Congress reduced the capital gains tax. Robertson: That’s right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And that must have made a difference to you. Robertson: Yes, I was very involved in that as a matter of fact.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh, were you? Well, tell me that story. Robertson: Ed[win] Zschau, who later ran for the senate here and had been a professor atStanford Business School, headed the American Electronics Associationcommittee on getting the capital gains tax reduced. And that’s right—it wasduring 1978 that that all happened. I was a member of a team that went andtestified before Congress on the bill. Ed was there, and David Morgenthaler,Sr., who was from Cleveland, but he was head of the National Venture CapitalAssociation. And then Bob [Robert N.] Noyce of Intel.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh, really! Bob Noyce! Robertson: Who was phenomenal. He had this booming, deep voice.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: There’s a phenomenal biography of him. Robertson: I’ve read a couple of them. He was a wild man! [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: He died too young.  Robertson: I just saw Ann last weekend at a party.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you know Reid Dennis? Robertson: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because he was also a part of that campaign. Robertson: Yes. He wasn’t a part of that particular thing that we did, but he was part of it,yes. I saw him at the same party last week. He was there.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: All right. Back to a really basic question. I see a lot of overlap between whatyou are doing and what venture capitalists are doing. So could you clarify thedistinction? Robertson: Well, the venture capitalists create the companies, and when they needliquidity, they like to take them public or merge them out, and that’s where theinvestment banking function comes in. So we could go call on Kleiner Perkinsor another venture capitalist, and talk to them about their portfolio. They’dsay, “Well, we’ve got these three companies that are really growing along,and, rather than do one more private finance, we think they might be ready fora public market.” So then we’d go call on those companies for them and takethem public and get the venture capitalists liquid. And if the company maybewasn’t doing quite so well or needed a lot of money and needed a bigcorporate partner, then we would be brought in to try to merge it withsomebody else.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see, and all this is in the context of what’s going on in the wider economy,right? You’re not going to take a company public in a down market, right? Robertson: That’s correct, yes. For instance in the last couple of years now, it’s been avery quiet IPO market, but that’s changing all of a sudden.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So what does that do to your business? Robertson: Well, you have to make it from things other than the IPO market.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: All right, so talk about those other things.  Robertson: The other thing you would do is you have a research department where theyknow these technologies in depth. You give those ideas to the institutionalinvestor, and they gave you brokerage business in return. It was a very steadybusiness. Most of these stocks were over the counter, so you made markets inthose stocks, and maybe you took an eighth between the bid and the ask andmade money that way.[End Audio File 1] Robertson: The venture capitalists create the companies, and then when they’re ready toget liquid on a company and take it public or merge it out, this is when theinvestment banker comes in. So we can go to a venture capitalist and say,“What are your best companies? Which ones do you want to get liquid onnow?” Then we would go and work directly with those companies abouttaking them public and getting them liquid so the venture capitalists could sellsome stock and get liquid. And then if the company isn’t quite ready to gopublic, maybe they need to be merged out. So you do a merger or acquisition.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, when you say a company is not quite ready to go public, what kind ofthings are you thinking about? Robertson: It’s either their top line or their bottom line isn’t large enough.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It’s really as simple as that? Robertson: Yes. It’s basically as simple as that. And that may be because they don’t havetheir product quite developed, or they’re waiting for a second generation tocome along which would be better suited for a larger market. But basically it’seither that top line or the bottom line isn’t enough yet.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, before we get too much further, I would like you to tell that lovely storyabout your wife’s definition of investment banking. Robertson: When I was dating my wife, she didn’t quite know what an investment bankerwas and didn’t know how that related to being a commercial banker. We hadtwo uninterrupted hours driving to Monterey for an American ElectronicsAssociation conference, so she said, “Let’s take this time—you tell me aboutthe business.” So I told her, talked for two hours about investment bankingand what we did. She says, “Okay. Now I’ve got it.” And she’s never askedme another question again. But at the end of that she said, “Well, it’s pretty easy what you do. You take money out of one pile, and you smoosh it around,and you put it in another pile.” And I said, “Well, that’s probably true, that’sall we do, but it’s very competitive.” [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That’s very nice. I do want to talk about biotech, and you just mentionedproducts as one of the aspects of your consideration of what to do with acompany. Biotech when you began associations with companies likeHybritech and Chiron and others, there were no products. So did you have toreadjust your criteria for how to deal with these new companies? Robertson: That’s right. In the biotech world, you saw what phase trials they were in andwhat the prospects were. Right now in 2010, it’s pretty difficult to finance abiotech company because it takes so long to get through the FDA, and there’snot a lot of money around to keep financing these things. So these companiesare hoarding their cash. In the very early days, people were betting—in a Genentech, for instance—that they could raise enough money to get through all these trials and get theirproducts to market. And it’s a fairly speculative bet.You were talking about Tom Perkins before. My first ever conversation aboutbiotechnology was with Tom, and we were having lunch at the Pacific UnionClub, where you’re not supposed to talk business or bring papers out on thetable. And Tom wanted to explain to me how Genentech worked, so he pullsout a piece of paper, and he draws a circle and he says: you take this slice outof an E. coli bacteria and you put this other thing in there. And they came overand said, “Oh, Mr. Perkins. I’m sorry, but you can’t have papers on the table.”We’ve always laughed that that might have set biotech back five years![laughter] But it was a totally new area for people, and there was a lot ofeducation to be done.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What was your attitude towards biotech? Robertson: It was extremely exciting stuff. Very, very exciting things, yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Tell me a little bit more why. It was new. Robertson: It was new. I’d always had an interest in the healthcare world, partly becauseof working for American Hospital Supply for a year, which gave me a crosssection view of the industry. In later years, I realized that it wasn’t a wastedyear because I got such a background in the healthcare world. But this was awhole new area. It had great promise. It could do things that chemistrycouldn’t do, and it was very, very exciting. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And you had Tom Perkins beating the drum. Robertson: We had Tom, and Brook Byers had started Hybritech, and we took that public.And then we sold that to Eli Lilly. We did more deals for Chiron than anyother client. We did ten or eleven transactions for Chiron to keep themfinanced and viable.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Of what nature? Robertson: First would be the IPO. Then maybe a secondary for them, really a secondprimary offering. We did convertible debt for them; we did mergers for them;we advised, along with others, on their final sale to the Swiss [Novartis], etcetera. So a company like that always needed money, and so they were verygood banking clients. They also were very subject to being merged, becauseyou could take two bio companies with two different product lines and putone layer of management over them rather than two layers of management—one in each company—and it would be more efficient.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It doesn’t sound to me as though you were much stymied by the fact that therewere no products in these companies at first—no certainty that there would beany near term. Why didn’t that bother you? Or did it bother you? Robertson: Well, you had to assess the risk. We had a very good biotech analyst by thename of Mark [J.] Simon, who then became a biotech investment banker forus. He was extremely good. He had worked in Wall Street as a number two toa very famous biotech analyst. Then we discovered that he was at HarvardBusiness School, and we made him a job offer and put him on the payroll sixmonths before he graduated just so he wouldn’t get hired away by someoneelse. And he turned out to be a great, great analyst.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did he have a biomedical background? Robertson: I think he had an undergraduate science degree, and his father and brotherwere both doctors, and he had a sense of it. He’s been extremely successful.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Knowing the technology, I’m assuming because you haven’t mentioned it allalong, doesn’t seem to be critical to your deciding to associate or not with acompany. A clearer way of saying that—the fact that you don’t have a heavytechnological background doesn’t stop you from deciding on investing?  Robertson: You mean personally?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, and your company as well. Is knowing the technology an importantaspect of the investment decision? Robertson: It is. I consider myself a generalist because I do semiconductors and softwareand biotech. But we had a stable of security analysts eventually that were veryvertically oriented, very much looked at different companies indepth. Thebiotech analyst though, as opposed to a semiconductor analyst, said, “Gee,every time you bring us a new company to look at, I’m looking at a differentindustry.” And he was somewhat correct, because the biotech companiesdiffer so much versus a chip company where you know what market they’regoing to go into, and you know how they’re doing the chip. A chip analyst canbe much more vertical, but the biotech analyst had to be vertical andhorizontal in looking at different things. So we ended up having three biotechanalysts at one point. So the investment banking side would rely on our ownin-house analysis—or we’d have to go outside. We had consultants who wereat NIH or in major pharmaceutical companies who we could rely on, and wehad a network of doctors and researchers. Apropos the science degree, as we speak today, I have a grandson in NewYork who has a science degree, just graduated from Dartmouth in December.He’s interviewing to work in investment banking in the biotech area or to joina biotech company, not as a scientist, although he’s worked in a lab and beenpaid in a lab, because he wants to go into the business side of biotech. He gothis first offer yesterday. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Good. Another sign that the economy is getting better too. Robertson: A little bit better.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: People with those bridge backgrounds, at least in the previous economy, usedto be really hot tickets. Robertson: That’s right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I’ve often wondered whether the people that were first interested, invested in,doing commercial biotech, if they really realized how hard the road was goingto be. FDA drug approval is one big hurdle, but there are other things too. Thescience doesn’t always work.  Robertson: Getting the science right. Yes, exactly.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What is your feeling about how gung-ho people were, maybe overly gung-hoabout where this new sector could go? Robertson: There’s a lot of bodies around. A lot of companies didn’t make it or gotmerged out. Maybe they had three products, and maybe one was half decent,so it got merged out. But a huge number did not make it. I’m a director of onebiotech company at the moment, and we’ve been in business ten years andexpect to get final approval sometime this year. But it’s been a ten-yearprocess.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You’ve obviously been willing to stick with it. Robertson: That’s right, and they’ve done their financing beautifully. They have acorporate partner now, so they have almost $200 million on their balancesheet, and the corporate partner is taking all the science risk from here on.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you think that because it is a long-term investment in almost every case,you and others think harder about associating with a biotech company? Robertson: As an investment banker you looked long and hard on this. Yes, very muchso, very much so.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And probably your old-time peers at Smith Barney would say you were crazy![laughter] Robertson: That’s right, exactly! Well, about ten years after we started, the old-time peerscalled on us and said, “Gee, let’s do some deals together. Bring us some of thedeals.” I said, “We don’t have to bring them to you anymore. We can do themourselves.”<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I mentioned off-tape that Bill [William J.] Rutter had responded to a questionfrom me about you, and I thought you might like to hear what he wrote back.“Sandy is one of the REAL important players in Biotechnology at theInvestment Banker level. You can ask him how much trepidation he had when 30representing rookies like Chiron, etc. [Robertson laughs] with minimal Robertson: Well, that’s right. They didn’t have a lot of venture backing. But Bill and Ed[Edward E.] Penhoet were a great team, and you have to make a judgmentsometimes on the people as much as on the product line. We had our analystlooking at what they were doing, and it was coming out favorably. We likedit, and then you talk to Ed and Bill. Bill had a fine reputation from UCSF, andEd had a great reputation at Berkeley, so we were betting on people as muchas anything.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You didn’t become associated with Chiron until they were ready for the IPO,which was 1983. Robertson: That’s right, that’s right. They were ready to go public, or they thought theywere ready to go public, and that’s when we met them. We didn’t know thembefore that.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I believe you just barely got under the wire there with Chiron’s IPO. Themarket closed down very soon after.was okay, and then it shut down.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So people do count. That’s interesting. Robertson: Oh, people absolutely do count, yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Would you go so far as to say that even if the financials and everything elseare right that if you have doubts about the people you might not do the deal? Robertson: We did one deal— I’m trying to think of how specific to be. We did one deal,and we took the company public. We turned down doing the secondarybecause our analyst was starting to have some reservations about thepresident. And years later, I think we were right. That president went to jail.The company’s been okay, but our analyst sensed the character right, and weturned down doing the next round. Rutter to <|endoftext|>
Interviewer, email correspondence, April 21, 2010. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I don’t know what proportion of successes you have had to failures. Would itbe instructive to also talk about a failure? Robertson: Sure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is this a time to look at the list [of companies with which Mr. Robertson hasbeen associated]. Robertson: These are all successes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, please think of a failure and why that might have been. Robertson: Well, we also did some retailing deals. I remember Nolan [K.] Bushnell whodid the first Pong game at Atari and did a company called Pizza Time Theater.There are still some of them around, where they had characters that came outand laughed—it was a pizza place. And we were thinking about taking thempublic, and I took my wife over to have dinner at one restaurant. The pizzawas very expensive. The kids would put quarters in the games, and it wouldcost you a lot of money to get in and out when the kids played all these gamesfor a quarter apiece. My wife said, “This is terrible. Don’t do this deal.” Well,we did it. It was very successful at the beginning, extremely successful. Theinstitutions loved it and everything, but it wasn’t well run. Nolan was a greatinnovator, but he wasn’t a restaurant chain manager. And so that did go under,and my wife said, “See? You need me on your commitment committee for thissort of thing.” [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you listen to her from then on? Robertson: [chuckling] In the technology world, the companies didn’t go bankrupt asmuch as get merged out, and maybe got merged out at a fraction of whatthey’d gone public for, or a fraction of what the venture capitalist had in them.But I’m trying to think of a bankruptcy that we did. It’s not deliberate, but Ican’t think of one, because they really would kind of fade away or thetechnology would be sold to somebody.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: In the investment banker world, is it usually a preference that a company stagean IPO rather than merge with an existing company? Is there a preference oneway or the other?  Robertson: Well, I always call it Eugene Kleiner’s Law. Kleiner’s Law was if you’re aventure capitalist and you’re about to invest in a company, he would say,“Don’t invest in it if you think you’re just going to merge it out. Only investin it if you think you can take it all the way to being a public offering.” Andthat’s very good advice, because usually if you’re selling it, there’s a limitednumber of other strategic buyers to sell it to, so you don’t get an auction goingon. If you take it public, you get the world looking at it, ready to buy theirsecurity. In the old days, if you had a company that you couldn’t take publicand you merged it out, the entrepreneur would kind of think of that as being afailure. Not so much anymore because you can sell it to Cisco or Google for abillion dollars, and you’re in pretty good shape.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do the financial rewards tend to be greater with an initial public offering? Robertson: They do. But back in ’99-2000, Kleiner Perkins was very smart. They hadsome companies that were somewhat competing with Cisco, and they wereabout to take them public at billion-dollar valuations. And if they did, theythen could have only sold a little bit of stock on the offering, and they wouldhave had to ease it out over some period of time. They sold two or threecompanies to Cisco at huge valuations, almost the valuations that they mighthave gotten in the public market—maybe not quite, but good valuations. Thenthey took Cisco stock, which was totally liquid—they probably couldn’t sell itfor three or six months—but it was much more liquid security than XYZCorp., where they would have owned 80 percent of it still, and they couldn’thave sold it on the market. They would have had to do that over five years.But Cisco was so large they could sell that stock almost immediately.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So Kleiner Perkins jumped on that in a way that other venture funds didn’t? Robertson: Actually just one of their partners. That was his strategy, and he did it verysuccessfully.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is that John Doerr? Robertson: No. [chuckling] No, it wasn’t John. It was Vinod Khosla.John held on. Johnwas involved with Amazon and with Google, and he just kept those, keptthose going.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Going back to the relationship between investment banking and venturecapital, do you ever find yourself, as an investment banker, at odds with whatthe venture capital partnership wants to do? How symbiotic is thatrelationship?  Robertson: Well, our job is to be honest with them, and so sometimes they’d want to takea company public, and we’d say, “It’s not ready.” And maybe they’d go toanother firm, maybe another firm wouldn’t do it, or maybe they’d want to dosomething we’d disagree with. It was a symbiotic relationship, but it wasn’talways 100 percent in phase.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Does a venture capitalist think of Robertson Stephens or what you are now,Francisco Partners, as being conservative or non-conservative in terms ofdeciding when a company is ready? What is your general reputation? Robertson: In the middle of that. At Robertson Stephens, we acted as an intermediary to amarketplace. We would try to figure out in advance what the company wouldbe worth to the institutional investors and try to pick that price. Sometimes ourcompetitors would say, “Oh, you’re worth 2x ,” what we’d say. And theventure capitalist would say, “Oh, he loves me more. We’d better go withhim.” We always tried to be very conservative in telling what we thoughtcompanies were worth. Then if we could sell it for a higher price, we would.But it was a testing of the market, and that’s where our function came in, tosay, “This company is going to be worth $150 million in the public market;therefore, it’s going to be $10 a share. We think that if we bring it at $10 ashare, it will open at $12, and then would grow from there.” That would havebeen the perfect way to do it. So we had to be honest with them and a little biton the conservative side.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Of course now you have years and years of reputation behind you. Anentrepreneur would know Robertson Stephens, that’s why he came to you, andnow presumably that extends to Francisco Partners. The entrepreneur mightsay to himself, “Well, these people have been in this field for so long, who amI to question their judgment?” Robertson: Yes, but Francisco, a private equity firm, is on the other side of the equationnow. What we’re doing is buying divisions of other companies or, as I like tosay, our Statue of Liberty companies: “Give me your tired and your poor.”We’re looking at companies that are doing poorly in the marketplace and canbe revived, or divisions that larger companies no longer want. We’re lookingat one now that we took public years ago, and it’s kind of a living dead. Wethink we can buy it, fix it up, and make a viable company of it again. So that’swhat Francisco does. So now if the investment banker is coming to us andsaying, “Oh, you’ve got this interesting company.” I say, “It’s now doing verywell. Shouldn’t we take it public again?” We have an offering going today, asa matter of fact.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Does that use basically the same skill sets that you’ve been using all along?  Robertson: Yes, we’re looking at it from the other side of the equation, but it’s the sameset.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why did you decide to do that? Robertson: Well, we sold Robertson Stephens. The other Four Horsemen got sold as well.And they all got ruined by the banks that bought them.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why did they sell in the first place? Robertson: Because the big guys were coming after us. The Morgan Stanleys and theGoldmans were coming after us.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That was because you had expertise that they needed? Robertson: No, they weren’t coming after us to buy us; they were coming after us tocompete, to take a Tandem or a Genentech public.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh, I see, because they were moving into this field, seeing what you had done. Robertson: So they wanted to do that, and they were successful at it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because they were so big. Robertson: Because they were so big, particularly Morgan and Goldman. And then CSFirst Boston later. But they were big. So then the other banks, the commercialbanks who didn’t have investment banking, came. Chase bought Hambrecht;Bank of America bought us; NationsBank bought Montgomery; Bankers Trustbought Alex Brown. But they were absorbed into their commercial banking,and the entrepreneurial spirit, or the spirit of these companies, all disappeared.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Nobody anticipated that? Robertson: They really didn’t. It was also a way to capitalize an earnings stream. Wecould have gone public or sold out. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: People have been wondering about Genentech and Roche: will thatentrepreneurial, risky, moving-on-a-dime kind of culture be killed by the bigcompany? Robertson: Yes. I think Roche should not have bought it, because when it still wasGenentech stock trading, they could give Genentech options for people. Sothose people could participate in the growth and the success of Genentechalone, without being a whole part of Roche. So I think there are reasons for itto be done, so I think it changes the character of Genentech.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, well, that’s going to be unfortunate. And for Roche too, because from mylimited understanding, a lot of Roche’s successful drugs came fromGenentech—I mean Genentech before the total acquisition. Robertson: Exactly. And they lost Susan Desmond-Hellmann, who was one of their copresidents and now chancellor at UCSF. Maybe she might not have been asattracted to that job if they were still partly independent.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, and Art Levinson is no longer CEO. Robertson: I didn’t know that.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: He’s chairman of the board but not CEO. Robertson: He’s on the Roche board, I know. I talked to him not long ago.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It’s a Roche person, whose name I can’t remember [Ian Clark], who was madeCEO. So time will tell. [chuckling] Robertson: Yes, well, that will take care of itself. I know Art’s on the Roche board, andhe’s enjoying that portion of it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was it a big disappointment/disaster for you when Robertson Stephens wasbought up? Robertson: Oh, we were sold first to BancAmerica, and that was working very well. Thenwhen BancAmerica and NationsBank merged— NationsBank had boughtMontgomery, and we spent a week seeing if we could put the two together,and it just wasn’t working. So BancAmerica, before the merger was consummated, sold us to BankBoston, and the character of the people atBankBoston was much different than the BancAmerica people. BancAmericahad said, “We’re going to leave you encapsulated. We’re not going to changeyour way of doing [things]. You can step out of your capsule and bring capitalin or call on our clients. That was working. They were doing a good job atthat.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: They were letting you alone, essentially. Robertson: They would help us win a piece of business. I remember I even flew to LA ona Saturday morning with the chairman. One of their clients was about to do amerger, was about to be hired by Montgomery, or he’d hired Montgomery todo something, and we came in at the last minute. And as BancAmerica, wetook the business away from Montgomery. But Bank of America was willingto hop on a plane on a Saturday morning to go do things like this for us, and itwas working very well. The BankBoston people were a different caliber. Frankly, they weren’t assmart, and they were a different— So I left soon after we went there. I didn’twant to work with these people. Then that BankBoston and RobertsonStephens became very contentious. They really hated each other. And one daythey just shut the firm down. I happened to be on the phone with the thenpresident. I was in Hawaii, and I was throwing him a piece of business—atender offer as a director of a company. Goldman had quoted $2 million, andthey’d quoted $1.5 million, and we were going to give the business to them. Inthe middle of the conversation he said, “I can’t even finish this conversation.They’ve just shut us down.” And two armed guards walked into his office sohe wouldn’t take any files with him. And so I was there, at the end, bytelephone.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What a dramatic story. Robertson: Very dramatic. They just shut the thing down cold. They should have justspun it off. One of the Minneapolis banks bought Piper Jaffray inMinneapolis, and then later spun it off to shareholders and created a hugeamount of value. BankBoston could have done the same thing, but theyweren’t very smart people. There’s a party given every year in July for all thealumni association of Robertson Stephens—one in New York and one here—acocktail party to celebrate, and people get together. I’ve been a couple oftimes; it’s kind of fun. I wasn’t there at the end, but it’s still fun to go to. Butin short, I’m glad the thing is shut down rather than something with my nameon it being run poorly. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, we’re running out of time, and we’ve skated over Francisco Partners.What more do you want to say about that? It looks like a big operation here! Robertson: [chuckling] Well, we have about $7 billion under management, and we’re aprivate equity or a leveraged buyout fund, only for technology. So we’re usingour background in this. And the guy running the firm now is someone I hiredout of Berkeley years ago for Robertson Stephens. He was the best youngcorporate finance analyst we ever had. We put him through Stanford BusinessSchool. He rejoined us, made him a vice president the first day out of businessschool, which we never had done before. He then did our semiconductorbusiness—he headed our semiconductor group. He left BankBostonRobertson Stephens to join Texas Pacific Group, TPG. Then he and I and athird guy in late 1999 formed Francisco, to do buyouts only in technology.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And was that more or less your decision? Robertson: Well, I was just being a corporate director at the time. I was on three publiclyheld boards, but I was doing investing of my own. It was actually his idea, andI thought it was a great idea.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you want to have his name on tape? Robertson: Yes, his name is Dipanjan Deb, or D.J. Deb.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is he Indian? Robertson: He’s Indian. He’s a real talent. I like to say I was his senior partner, and nowhe’s my senior partner. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And you’re happy doing this? Robertson: Very happy doing this.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you think about retirement? Robertson: I’m never going to retire, like my father. At eighty years old he was stillstarting companies. It’s much more interesting than playing golf. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, two more sets of questions. One is about this region. We did a bit ofcompare and contrast with the eastern philosophy as opposed to the western.But what is there to say about this region, and the fact that we have a SiliconValley here that people around the world are trying to duplicate? But there areother things about it that have made it such a rich place, until very recentlywith the recession, for high technology and risk investment and investmentbanking, and all the things that you’ve been involved with. Robertson: Right. Well, a spark starts and then it spreads. Going way back into theforties—late thirties and forties, Dean [Frederick E.] Terman at Stanford gotHewlett and Packard together. Then the semiconductor business, which couldhave been in New Jersey, moved out here, and Fairchild then fathered all thatindustry. Once you get something started, it really kind of grows upon itself.Maybe someone had made enough money on his Fairchild options to say,“Okay. I can live off this for a year while I start another semiconductorcompany.” That spark happened here and in Boston. Interestingly, Bostonseems to be quieting down, and some of those venture firms are really movingmore of their operations to the West Coast. This still has the entrepreneurialspark, and that’s picked up in other areas of the country—Seattle. There havebeen spinoffs of Microsoft up there. Austin, Texas is becoming very good. Alot of the semiconductor industry moved to Texas, from Silicon Valley, andyou have a big university. San Diego has been a big center because ofHybritech starting there. Something has to get going to get it going. AnnArbor, I thought the University of Michigan—that spark hadn’t happeneduntil just recently, in just the last about five years.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Does that often boil down to an individual or a set of individuals? Robertson: It boils down, usually, I think, to a company starting, where some peoplemade some money and there’s an example. There was a company in AnnArbor years ago that Hambrecht took public, that was very successful. Ithought that was going to spark things there, and it didn’t. And then theorientation there was toward robotics for the automobile industry, whichdidn’t turn out to be a very big market. It only had three or five customers ormaybe ten worldwide. So that wasn’t that good. Now the biotech spark hasgotten going back there. Warner-Lambert Pfizer used to have a big plant, a bigresearch facility there. So there are these seeds that make things grow.California is way ahead of everybody else because we’ve been here seventyyears.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But Silicon Valley has been really hard hit by this recession. Do you have anyfeeling about the long-term repercussions?  Robertson: Well, I don’t think it’s as bad as other parts of the economy. Technology hasrecovered faster than other parts of the economy, and yes, we’ve been hit. AndCalifornia is a tougher place to live with our tax burden, et cetera, here now.So lots of companies are building plants, they’re going to— Texas is a veryattractive place to go. So rather than expand here, they may do the next plantin Austin, Texas.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see, but they still keep an operation here. Robertson: Absolutely, an operation. And a lot of the manufacturing of semiconductors,for instance, has gone overseas. The design is still here. But now the design isstarting to be done in China and India. They’ve got lots of engineers doinglots of good things. We haven’t lost the leading edge here yet, but it’s going tobe more competitive.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, the last thing—and of course you speak up, too, about more topics—isphilanthropy. What are your interests in terms of philanthropy? Robertson: In terms of philanthropy—education and healthcare. I’m involved withMichigan and have given them some money, and my wife has been veryinterested in UCSF. She’s been chairman of their foundation. She’s still ontheir board. She’s not chairman at the moment, but it doesn’t seem likeanything’s changed. She was a part of different teams that raised $37 millionfor them last year and is working on a $100 million gift from someone at themoment. So she’s very involved in the healthcare world. She also had sonswith mental health problems who are at McLean Hospital, which is Harvard’steaching hospital for mental health, and she’s been very involved in themental health world as well. And those are where education and healthcareoverlap a little bit.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, I can see that. And then, as we were talking with Caroline Crawford [thevideographer] off tape about your interest in jazz. Robertson: That’s right. Jazz is the great American art form. It’s almost more appreciatedin Europe than it is here. We go to the symphony and the ballet, and so muchof these things are European composers or choreographers. But jazz is anAmerican art form, and it was started here and developed here.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is it a lifelong interest of yours? 40 Robertson: Yes, it is. My father played the piano by ear, and he wrote the Northwesternfootball song [“Rise, Northwestern.”] I don’t have the talent in my hands thathe did, but I love music, yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you play an instrument? Robertson: I play the piano privately. [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, this has been a pleasure for me. Do you have anything that you want toadd? Robertson: Well, technology is still one of the two best things that the United States doesbetter than the rest of the world. The other one is agriculture. We havemassive farms using heavy capital equipment. We can grow food cheaper thanany other country in the world, and we’ve become a little bit of a bread basketfor them. But then the other thing that’s really important for our country is oursemiconductor base, our software base. These two things together have keptus ahead of the rest of the world in technology, and we have to run fast to staythere. I think we’ll have that leadership for years, but we’ve got to keep thatleadership. And it’s an extremely important part, and an increasing part of theU.S. economy.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Education, I can well imagine, is an important part of that. Robertson: And education feeds into that. Right. We’ve got to change our visa problems,and let some of these graduate students stay here and contribute to oureconomy. With our visa problems at the moment, the PhDs that we train aregoing back to China and India, Taiwan, Israel. We should keep them here.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I thank you. Robertson: It’s been very much fun. Thank you!
