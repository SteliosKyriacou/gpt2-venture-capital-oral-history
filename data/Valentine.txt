Interviewer: Today is October 20, 2009 and this is the first interview with DonaldValentine. I’d like to start at the beginning, namely where you were born,what it was like to grow up in your family, and your early schooling.Valentine: Suppose I don’t like subjects like that, can we finesse them?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, sure. But not only are people interested in where you came from, but inmany cases it shows the evolution of how you got where you got, and whatyou may have picked up along the line that you later found useful, or not. So,go through it as much you can stand, please.Valentine: You’ll find that I like dealing in brevity and summary. As is true of a lot ofpeople, I was born and raised in the East where it snowed, and I vowed neverto live anywhere where it snowed on my driveway. So I came to California.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] And that’s the early life of Donald Valentine?Valentine: Well, I mean that’s a motivation that got me here.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, yes, but there was something in between.Valentine: Not especially exciting or relevant.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I don’t know that I agree. One thing that I learned is that virtually allyour schooling, with the exception of business school at UCLA, was inCatholic schools.Valentine: Correct.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, what did that instill?Valentine: Well, the one thing that I remember that it instilled—the Catholic nuns did notallow people to write left-handed. The Italian word for left is sinistra, whichalso obviously means sinister. And the Catholic nuns thought people whowrote left-handed were sinister, so you wrote right-handed. And they poundedyou with a yardstick until you changed, and I discovered that I didn’t changeeasily. [<|endoftext|>
Interviewer chuckles] So yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So there was a little contention?Valentine: I wouldn’t quibble over the adjective, but I think it was more than a little. Ihad demonstrated a technique of writing left-handed that I think qualified forthe Palmer writing system that they felt strongly about, which only got me afew more lashes of the yardstick.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And how do you write nowadays? With which hand?Valentine: As you have seen, I don’t write at all, I print.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: All right, you print, but it’s very beautiful, as I told you off tape.Valentine: Thank you. It’s an accident of a violent learning experience. So, if you likethis Catholic orientation, I started with Franciscan nuns who were generalists,not especially well educated, very passionate about their faith, and very adeptat beating you.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Physically, you mean?Valentine: Did you ever get hit this way? [demonstrating]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: No. On the ears?Valentine: Wherever their hands happened to hit on your head. I graduated from the nunsto Marist brothers who were slightly better educated and were not given toviolence. That’s because the kids were bigger.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: This was high school?Valentine: Yes, Mount Saint Michael, and retaliation was always the threat. And then Iwas educated by the Jesuits at Fordham who are very highly educated bycomparison to my prior experience, and their idea of brutality was intellectual.As a generalization, they were well educated, they were smart, and they wouldbait you into positions that clearly demonstrated their superiority. They used aSocratic technique of teaching.Norton: Can I ask where you went to college?Valentine: Fordham University.Norton: I went to Holy Cross.Valentine: Ah! A similar kind of fraternity.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And I had a stint with the Catholics too, way back. So some of what you’resaying, not the physical beating aspect, but others I think we both canprobably identify with.Valentine: Yes, having never gone to any other kind of school, they are very relevanthistorically. And it’s an interesting history. Dan Brown, a current activeauthor, is making a lot of progress writing about things that involved, orinvolve, history and fantasizing about different elements and timing of theCatholic Church.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, let me ask you one more thing and then we’ll leave it. What did thisrather rocky introduction to Catholicism do for your faith?Valentine: [pause] Interesting question. Never thought about the question, don’t have apat answer. I suspect since it was the only religious orientation I was everexposed to, until I got to the Jesuit’s level of education I never thought aboutalternatives. So, dealing with the question more obliquely, my middle initial isT for Thomas. Thomas was the apostle who was the doubting person.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Doubting Thomas.Valentine: It probably did a great deal to encourage both my inquisitiveness andinclination not to believe what I was told or heard. Now, how is that relevant?In the business I’m in, it’s all about figuring out which questions are the rightquestions to ask, and since we don’t have a clue what the right answer is we’revery interested in the process by which the entrepreneur gets to the conclusionthat he offers. Our business is a business of highly intuitive decision makingand the fact that it’s done in a scientific area doesn’t make it scientifically,practical to make decisions that way. So—long-winded answer about faith.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: The way you describe yourself at a young age is you’re not sitting around justtaking what’s thrown at you. Does that have some relationship to the way youwere raised? What about your parents?Valentine: [pause, sigh] I’m struggling to make a connection. Neither were educated,neither graduated from grade school.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Really?Valentine: Both were dedicated readers, but rather random and not especially purposefultoward an objective. Reading for entertainment was much more a descriptivethan attempting to learn a body of knowledge about anything. I don’t thinkthere was a connection. My grandparents were equally uneducated, so thereisn’t a real nexus between the family pasts, regardless of generations, that Ican recognize or conclude.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I can think of two ways that it might. First of all, they may have wantedmore for you. So that leads to the question, did they want you to exceedacademically? Did they want you to go to good schools?Valentine: I have a brother, and if I were to judge, I would say that our parents wereinterested but allowed us to make the decisions, deferring I think because oflack of familiarity with choosing a high school, lack of familiarity of choosinga college. So I think they deferred to however the school influenced andformed our thinking about what to do next.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were they pleased when you achieved?Valentine: Yes. The family member I learned the most from was my Danish grandfatherwho explained to me that despite the fact that you cannot write left-handedyou should eat left-handed, and that you should eat everything. [<|endoftext|>
Interviewerchuckles.] And by trial and error you’ll find things that you like a lot andthings that you like less, and just eat the things you like a lot but tryeverything.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you extend that philosophy beyond food?Valentine: It’s the only areas in which he and I interacted. He was only partially anEnglish-speaking man and unfortunately lost his hearing in the SpanishAmerican War. I have no idea why he was in the Spanish-American War, buthe was. As far as I know there was no draft or anything in those days. And hewas clearly an immigrant from Copenhagen, so what he was doing in Cubawas a mystery to me.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now the other way I could imagine some connection, stepping back a bit, Iread that your father was a truck driver and a Teamster?Valentine: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That, speaking very stereotypically, produces an image in my mind ofsomebody who is no patsy. I imagine a strong individual?Valentine: Headstrong. Yes. The fundamental basis of conversation between us onanything that had any consequence was his dedicated position of being in aunion, the Teamsters, and eventually becoming a very, very minor functionaryin the Teamsters. His argument was: you know you clearly are opposed to theunions but they got you where you are. I don’t remember what I said but itwas probably something like, “It’s part of overcoming my past.You know I’m going to edit all of this out. This is never going to see the lightof day.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, then you’re going to get some opposition from yours truly.Valentine: It’ll have to do with the next two hours.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] Are you issuing an ultimatum?Valentine: If it came across like an ultimatum, it’s an ultimatum.Norton: You’re the first venture capitalist who’s threatened us. [chuckling].<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Chalk that one up!Valentine: I will be the first to do a lot of things that you haven’t encountered before.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, we’re a pretty vicious group.Valentine: Yes, right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I’m wondering if that rough-and-ready family background didn’t start you offin a certain direction, and I mean in terms of how you confronted the world.Valentine: Well, it’s interesting because I don’t remember ever thinking about thesethings. Once I protested to my father that I was getting tired of these regularbeatings, and he said, “Well, they wouldn’t beat you if you weren’t doingsomething wrong, so clean up your act!” I think he was very inclined towardauthority and its relevance, and I became just the opposite. I was—terribleattitude about the military. Didn’t like, don’t like regimentation. Don’t likeinterviewers telling me what we have to talk about even if I don’t want to talkabout it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] You seem to be doing a good job.Valentine: Time will tell.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, let’s go through more or less chronologically. Skipping over grammarschool, but by the time you got into high school, and then Fordham, did youknow what you were interested in?Valentine: No.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What were you studying? What did you like?Valentine: High school, an all-boys school, small, was a matter of the normal, generalreading and writing and arithmetic approach. There were opportunities to takecourses, and I would take courses more in technical areas simply because thenature of the teachers were better. And they were teaching things about whichI knew absolutely nothing. So there’s a sort of an indirect selection process,but of not very many options.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You liked the practicality of it? Or was it just this was better instruction?Valentine: I think it was because the instructors were better, and so better instructionwould be my choice in that multiple choice. I don’t know anything about HolyCross, but I suspect it’s the same in the general sense of it being a universitythat has different schools. Fordham has a school of pharmacy, a school of law,a school of education, both at the graduate level and the undergraduate level.But you spend two or two-and-a-half years taking the core prerequisitecourses, after which you got to choose something if you had something inmind that you wanted to choose, with a big dollop of religion, which becameprogressively more optional as you went from sophomore year to junior yearto senior year.So, probably most interesting to me in those days was chemistry. I now have a16-year-old grandson who is an exceptionally good student, and he asked whyI took chemistry. He thinks of chemistry as a difficult high school subject. Itold him that the periodic table had very few elements then compared tonow—a lot of things have been discovered in 50 years. More blanks than therewere elements, and you could tell from the electron valences what thechemistry of the unit would be when found. I said, “It was easy, I only had tolearn about a dozen elements. You have to worry now about 150.”He said, “You have to be kidding! You didn’t have these elements then?” AndI said, “No, they were invented between my time being fifteen and my timenot being fifteen.” So it’s different, and that’s as close as I would have gottento something exceptionally technical.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why Fordham; why did you go there?Valentine: One of two reasons was the primary reason. It was close and an easycommute, and it was inexpensive. My father’s position was you can go to anyschool you want. It’s your problem getting there and back; it’s my problempaying for it, and this is what I’m going to pay. Teamsters don’t make a lot ofmoney. It’s the top of the Teamsters that are rich because they have access tothe treasury.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] And your father didn’t.Valentine: My father didn’t have access to the treasury. I was one of the few people whowent to school, paid their tuition quarterly in cash. My father did not have achecking account, so there was no way to take a check.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, so where are we, about 1950? No, we’re a little later than that becauseyou graduated from Mount St. Michael’s Academy in 1950. So we’re sort of1954, 1955, right?Valentine: They were all the same.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, well, the fifties were—Valentine: Not much going on.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What happened there that might have set you in certain directions?Valentine: There was a mandatory draft, and I was drafted.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Right.Valentine: And I found out my sense of disobedience was not totally civil, in eitherdefinition of the word. I was a terrible soldier. Fortunately, the period of timethat I was in the military was an Olympic year, and somebody decided to getall of the athletes together. And to develop teams, basketball, water poloteams, whatever kind of teams, to compete in the Olympic trials and toeventually go to Helsinki. So I saw this as my way out of the military. I was inthe army in electronics, trying to teach senior officers to use moderntechnology instead of the way they were inclined to fight wars. I fortunatelygot sent, after being in the army for about twelve or thirteen months, I got sentto the navy.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why was that?Valentine: Why? That’s where all of the water polo players in the world were beingtrained. So I was in the navy for nine months, stationed in California—where Ifinally found a place where it does not snow in February. So I knew where Iwas going to live, and I got out of the military as fast as possible.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now what about the water polo?Valentine: What about it?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were you playing it?Valentine: They gathered probably thirty to forty people—it is amazing to me how themilitary doesn’t change. They put us all on a naval base, a naval base that wasa naval flight base. So our water polo team had its own air force. There were ahalf-a-dozen pilots among us and any number of planes available to us so thepilots could practice. And the first thing that happened after breakfast, we sentout two planes. One went north, one went south, and the whole purpose ofreconnoitering the ocean was to find out where the biggest waves were. Andas soon as the choice was made, they radioed back to get the station wagonsready. We were going to go to Huntington Beach where the outside break wasspectacular in the morning, and we would surf all morning.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] And you wanted to get out of this?Valentine: Huh?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You wanted to get out of the military when this is what you were doing?Valentine: Then we had training in the afternoon. So we were in the water surfing forfour or five hours, and then we played water polo for several hours.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Sounds tough.Valentine: And yes, I wanted out of the military. So at one point in time, it turns out noone was keeping records. You could get out in that draft era in twenty-onemonths. I applied to get out—and this is before the Olympic trials. One of thesenior people managing this program said, “Well, if you extend your stay inthe military we’re going to, in addition to the Olympic trials, go on a worldtour and play water polo all over Western Europe.” I told him, “Tell me whenthe tour ends to the day, and I’ll extend to that day, not a minute longer.” “No,you have to extend for a year.” So I moved into a fraternity house at USC[University of Southern California] when my time was over. That’s where thebig pools were in Los Angeles in those days. And that’s where the Olympictrials were conducted, the preliminary rounds, at SC, at the Coliseum. So mymilitary career ended without my having to fire a rifle or any other kind ofweapon, in a fraternity house at SC.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] That’s pretty good!Valentine: And the thing I learned was that SC had the best dental school on the WestCoast, and as a result my dentist from 1956 onward has been an SC dentist.And they were right; they have a good dental school. So that’s all I learned inthe military.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: All right, well, that’s a different sort of military career than I am familiar with.Does UCLA business school come next?Valentine: It was an interesting experience. I was just interested in taking courses in salesand marketing. While working, I took those in the late afternoon. Thesecourses were conducted—what’s the course that they teach where cooking’sinvolved? Something or other economics or economy or—Norton: Home economics.Valentine: Home economics. Home economics and marketing were in adjacent rooms.So I took marketing and an early dinner or a late lunch every day at the homeeconomics class before going to taking my curriculum.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] You’re figuring things out pretty well, aren’t you?Valentine: Mmm, yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I couldn’t figure out the chronology here. You were at Sylvania Electric?Valentine: No, I had long since moved on. Sylvania Electric was back where it snows.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh, okay. So that was right after Fordham, before you went into the military?Valentine: No, Fordham, the military, Saint Sylvania Electric [<|endoftext|>
Interviewer chuckles] that hadWest Coast facilities. So my entire objective was to get employed inelectronics in a company that had West Coast facilities, another schemingoriented career move.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I am picking up on that. You hadn’t any particular interest at that point inelectronics?Valentine: Very interested in electronics. Sylvania was not a great example of advancedcapability. They were an old-line company. Sylvania is half of the wordPennsylvania, and they had factories all over Pennsylvania and upstate NewYork.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But it did get you to California.Valentine: Yes! Never, never to look back.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] You don’t miss the snow?Valentine: No. See I’m a great believer going back to then that Frederick Jackson Turnerwas right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Westward young man.Valentine: It’s all about—the perimeter of civilization is where things happen.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But you didn’t have that concept as a young man, did you?Valentine: Soon as I read Frederick Jackson Turner I did.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So that was another reason for going west; it wasn’t just a matter of weather?Valentine: Yes, it was a confirmation that you could have great weather and be on theleading level, or leading edge of opportunity of any kind. You’d be in ourcountry, in the West. And if you look retrospectively then, Europe, which is tome the East, was dead and an economic disaster. This is postwar by ten years.So it’s a Marshall Plan, and it’s a mess. The near East, Boston and places likethat, had not a lot happening in electronics. But it was the only place in theU.S., other than the West Coast, where something was happening, because ofM.I.T. and Harvard and a few of the great universities that are there. But theywere flawed; they had snow, and I’m not interested in that.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] We seem to be getting back to that.Valentine: It was a very easy decision for me. Follow Frederick Jackson Turner wherethe weather’s good and life will be fine.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And it was.Valentine: Which I proved.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So you’re not enrolled full time, I gather, at UCLA.Valentine: No, no.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You’re taking courses as you can.Valentine: Right, I’m not interested in a degree.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now why is that?Valentine: I don’t believe in business school.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why?Valentine: We have people here at Sequoia who went to business school, but most of theprimary partners here have not gone to business school. Or said differently,and this is a true story, when asked where I went to business school, I said,“Fairchild Semiconductor.” And the people said, “We’ve never heard of it.” Iwas talking to people who thought that if you didn’t go to Harvard BusinessSchool you could never learn how to manage money. And my rejoinder was Iwas not interested in learning how to raise money; I was interested in buildinggreat companies, and I didn’t have to go Harvard Business School to buildgreat companies.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Where does that idea come in—building big companies. Are you collapsingtime here?Valentine: Great companies. Yes, I’m trying to get to something I’m interested in talkingabout, instead of all this stuff you’re interested in talking about, if you want tomake a sharp point of it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [laughing] All right, well, we’ll move along then if I’m boring you—or you’reboring yourself.Valentine: Boring myself.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, you did admit that you hadn’t thought of some of the things that I askedquestions about.Valentine: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: At least one of the classes, or maybe all the classes that you were taking atUCLA you said were in sales and marketing. Why that particular facet ofbusiness?Valentine: Well, once having established a Fredrick Jackson Turner thesis personally, itwas a question then of what do you do? Well, early on at Sylvania I learned Iwas not going to be a great scientist. And in a world where things change alot, it’s usually a world in which science has a major component in the changethat’s going on. So I knew I couldn’t do that and didn’t want to do that. Sowhat else is there to do in a great company? Where is the decision-makingprocess in a great company? And the answer is it’s in marketing. In a well-runcompany, the marketing department in conjunction to the science departmentdecides, based on what their capabilities are, what problems they can solve,and what sequence should they solve them in, and how much money can theyspend on developing that product, and how big is the market? Who’s going tobuy this stuff? And that all happens with marketing in a primacy position. AndI would guess, I don’t know who you talked to among your twelve othervictims, that very few of them were real marketing people.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That’s true.Valentine: I didn’t choose marketing because I was going to be in the venture business; Ichose marketing because I thought that was the best place for me to be, on theWest Coast, in new ideas and new companies.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And you really had thought this through in your twenties, or whatever youwere, thirties?Valentine: Yes, true.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Very deliberately.Valentine: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That’s kind of amazing.Valentine: I suspect there’s a hidden compliment there which I’ll thank you for and moveon. The point though is I don’t think recognition is a great art form, becausethat’s what we do here [at Sequoia]. We recognize by Socratic questioningopportunities that are better than others, and why. And it seemed to fit myinformation-processing ability and interest. So yes, I—very geographycentric. Unlike Pitch [Franklin “Pitch” Johnson]—did you ever talk to Pitch?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes.Valentine: He worked in a steel mill somewhere in Ohio or somewhere. I mean, youcouldn’t get six marines strong enough to drag me into a steel mill in InlandSteel in Ohio. Pitch has a totally different agenda and thought-processingsystem. He was willing to do that; I was not willing to do that. I knew what Iwas willing to do and where I wanted to do it. And tenacity is an adjective thatdoes work for me.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I can sort of agree with that. [chuckling] I do want to hear about Fairchild.Valentine: Fairchild was my major education.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You implied that.Valentine: You can skip all three schools and the beatings with the nuns and thefascination with the Jesuits. Fairchild was an early company when I joined it. Iwas maybe employee number forty or fifty or something like that. It was inMountain View, California, and it was in a leadership technology area—unproven. For which, if you had the right imagination to go with the product,it could have been, and did become, a spectacular company. It is the mother ofall the spinouts in Silicon Valley.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Had you been following Fairchild, or semiconductors, or anything related toit?Valentine: Semiconductors.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why?Valentine: Because in my opinion, the whole world of electronics components prior tosemiconductors was vacuum tubes. And places like General Electric madethem, and Philco made them, and RCA made them, and Sylvania made them,and they were all dead companies—East Coast, hidebound on the past, notforward looking or thinking. They all went out of the television business, theyall went out of the vacuum tube business, they were never a factor in thesemiconductor business. So my bet was that the semiconductor business wasthe business of the future in electronics. All of that stuff initially was madewith an element called germanium, which in its fundamental properties was avery limited capability material.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was that what [William] Shockley was using as well?Valentine: No. The people that got the Nobel Prize, of whom Bill Shockley was one,were in Bell Labs working on primarily germanium, but also other materials.But the first transistors were all germanium. And Fairchild Semiconductorwas the first company, as far as I could find, anywhere in the world that beganmaking the semiconductors with silicon.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now, for somebody naive in this field—me—why is silicon superior togermanium?Valentine: The fundamental, elemental characteristics. So one of the things that happensin general in chemistry is when you heat a material it changes its activity andits performance capabilities. Germanium had a limited temperature range ofperformance capabilities. When exceeded it was worthless; it would die.Silicon worked at much, much higher temperatures. If anything, the higher thetemperatures the better. So you had a real fundamental occurrence of thebeginning of recognition. Everything made in the semiconductor businessthese days is made with silicon. Ninety-nine percent of every dollar soldworldwide, by any country, is silicon.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And had Bell Labs been moving in that direction?Valentine: Yes, all the big laboratories. They’re places that experiment and developscience and technology; they don’t make things unfortunately, but that’s adifferent story. Fairchild Semiconductor of Mountain View, California was astart-up, and that’s why in my opinion it was the best education I had, andinfinitely better than any business school education.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, look at the people you were rubbing shoulders with. Do you want to saya little bit about that? I imagine there was some one-on-one education ifyou’ve got Bob Noyces [Robert N. Noyce] and Gordon Moores [Gordon E.Moore] and people of that ilk in what was then quite a small company right?Valentine: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How many people where there, how many employees when you joined,roughly?Valentine: Well, if I was employee number fifty, there were forty-nine.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] All right, yes.Valentine: I mean it was a very small company, and that’s in all disciplines.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I read somewhere you were not in the original— what did they call them,the—Valentine: The Traitorous Eight.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: The Traitorous Eight.Valentine: Bill Shockley called them that.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, right, understandably. He must have been more than a little disturbed,because there went his brain power, right?Valentine: He got what he deserved.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Had you been following all that, too? You were very aware of what washappening at Shockley Semiconductor?Valentine: The decision to follow silicon was like the decision to follow FrederickJackson Turner. Once I began to understand the thesis, the thesis of silicon,having taken chemistry, it was very obvious when you looked at the propertiesof the alternatives.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Give me a picture of what you found when you arrived at Fairchild and whatyou then did.Valentine: Well, the eight people were of different disciplines. Nobody had anymanagement experience, nobody had any manufacturing experience. Thesewere incredibly bright, narrow-focused individuals. So one guy knew all therewas to know about silicon, but he didn’t know if tomorrow was Wednesday orThursday—wasn’t interested. So you had a talent pool that retrospectivelywas perfect, except they had to learn how to make them, and they had to learnhow to sell them. And I was one of the people sent to Los Angeles in sales.million, or $1.5 million. In 1960, I sold five times as much in Los Angelesmyself. So this was product that everybody had been waiting for; they justdidn’t know it. So we had fabulous science, we learned how to make the stuff,and it solved big problems. And the customers were often in the military andaerospace business. There was a fairly famous defensive missile, called theMinuteman, that was filled with all this stuff. And Fairchild was born.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I’m imagining, and it doesn’t take much imagination, that with a newbreakthrough product like that you had to do a lot of educating.Valentine: Well, yes. In a big company, the people who are the real buyers are technicalengineers who design them into the electronics equipment. And that’s easy,because the alternative was so poor by comparison. The difficulty at sellingthem is when you get to the manager in the company, and the managementdiscovers that some tiny company from Podunk has all these designs, andthey’re appropriately worried. And that’s where you encounter the difficultyof being bonafide. And whenever we encountered that, and it’s one of thegreat advantages of the small company, I called Bob Noyce and said, “Wehave some problems here. Everything’s fine in engineering, but now we’re atthe bureaucratic level and we need you to visit.”<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And he would?Valentine: He would, oh sure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was it at this stage or a little bit later that you had your rather famous salesconferences?Valentine: The sales conferences?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Or was that when you were at National Semiconductor?Valentine: No, that was at Fairchild. I never considered them famous. We were doublingand tripling sales every year. There are two things in business that matter, andyou can learn this in two minutes—you don’t have to go to business school fortwo years: high gross margins and cash flow. All the other financial metricsyou can forget. The accountants can get the numbers into the boxeseventually, but if you have a product with high gross margins, and Fairchilddid, it generates huge cash flow. And that means you can grow the companyas fast as the market will allow. And that’s what we were doing. And webegan having sales meetings—not unprecedented—at one resort-like placeafter another. So we went to Hawaii. No big deal.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was that a new idea?Valentine: [chuckling] It was for the people at Fairchild!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were other companies doing this sort of thing to sell their goods?Valentine: Oh yes, the big companies like RCA and GE had—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: They’d been doing all that.Valentine: There’s nothing very fancy about that. I mean it’s a matter of just taking asmall number of people to someplace like Hawaii. We’re now in the veryearly mid-sixties. We had employees in the company who thought Hawaii wasright next to Japan, and that they could go for the weekend before the meeting,stop in Tokyo for a couple of days, and then go to Hawaii. It was amusing toexplain to people that once you got to Hawaii you had another three thousandmiles to go. But none of those people grew up when Pearl Harbor was areality. So that’s Fairchild Semiconductor.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Are you going to keep track of some of these people as you move on in life?Valentine: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: There’s a name that I picked up from that interview you pointed out—Roger[G.] Kennedy. I wasn’t clear what—Valentine: Oh, Roger had nothing to do with the semiconductor days. Roger was thehead of the Ford Foundation.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Where does that come in?Valentine: When I first tried to raise money to be in the venture business.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So I’m jumping ahead. I couldn’t tell from that interview where it fitted in. Somaybe we should wait until we get there?Valentine: Sure. Roger was early seventies.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: There’s something going on I believe at this time. There’s this thing calledThe Group, right?Valentine: I don’t know.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, again, it’s from reading and also talking to Bill [William K.] Bowes,who spoke to me quite a bit about The Group, a loose group of friends whohad some money and were investing.Valentine: Oh, totally different era. I didn’t realize we had left the semiconductorbusiness and had moved on.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I thought this was happening in the sixties, right?Valentine: Not for me; I was gainfully employed in the semiconductor business for all ofthe sixties until the early seventies.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I read that you were beginning to privately invest when you were atFairchild.Valentine: That’s true.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But it’s not with this group?Valentine: No.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: All right, well, I think that’s relevant to the story, do you not?Valentine: I don’t know. Who the hell is in the group? I’ve never heard of them.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: No, I mean the fact that you were beginning to privately invest.Valentine: Yes, yes. That’s sort of a sideline. If there was a group I was not among theinvited.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh, okay. Well, you haven’t addressed my question about private investment.Valentine: If you stop interrupting me I’ll— It’s on the tip of my tongue.20<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] It’s lucky I have a sense of humor. I could be very intimidated,but strangely enough I’m not.Valentine: Good for you. That’ll eliminate one story anyway, about the guy I talked to,apparently very sternly, and he fainted.[interruption]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: We have five minutes before a tape change.Valentine: Ah! Fairchild is spawning companies left and right. Our major resource is ourengineering, and customer after customer comes along and wants us to dosomething slightly different than we’re doing. What’s wonderful about thesemiconductor companies is their production. They make a lot of units similarto the concept of Henry Ford. You can have any kind of unit you want as longas it’s black, and it’s made this way, and that’s the way the industryflourished. Certain big customers wanted their products slightly differently.We didn’t have the engineering resources to take care of all these people, so Ievolved a system of selection. Which companies are we going to make thesespecial units for? What are the ingredients of these companies? How big aretheir markets? How good is their management? And we would maybe make aspecial product for one out of fifteen.And I began to think that maybe that selection process could also be used todetermine which companies might make interesting investments. Fairchildwas not interested in investing in these kinds of companies, so I said, havingfailed to persuade the board that they should, that I would do it. And I beganmaking very, very small personal investments in these companies which wewere treating specially, and I did it alone. If there was another group of peopledoing it, as I mentioned earlier, I wasn’t invited, I didn’t participate, I didn’teven know who Bill Bowes was.[End Audio File 1]Valentine: One final comment on this concept of a group. One of the things that willbecome more and more evident to you is that my own personal inclination hasnever been to be part of a group. I have always tended to be, without trying,very individualistic—very selfish, in the Ayn Rand definition of selfish, andit’s comfortable for me.So having said that, we’ve established that Fairchild is the mother of all spinoffs, and at a particular time, early 1967, a number of us were organizing toleave Fairchild. Bob Noyce was still the manager. It was still a division ofFairchild’s Camera and Instrument [Corporation]. In my exit interview withBob, who for me was the smartest person that I’ve ever known— He had anincredible blind spot and none of us could persuade him with any argument.He was a dedicated smoker, and he smoked cigarettes that had no filters, andhe died of heart attack. And Gordon [Moore], Victor Grinich—we all arguedwith him unsuccessfully. He was unmovable on this subject.So anyhow, it was our time to leave. Bob said, “Okay we have to talk about it.I have these great ideas.” I agreed that he had great ideas continuously. Andhe said in addition—it’s early 1967—“It’s too late to start a semiconductorcompany.”<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why were you not happy just to stay with him at Fairchild?Valentine: Because the nature of the structure—Fairchild Camera and Instrument was acompany on Long Island, had multiple divisions. All the earnings forFairchild Camera and Instrument came from Fairchild Semiconductor, and themanagement took that cash flow and invested in all these other turkeys thatwere terrible! And they wouldn’t provide enough equity participation for thepeople at Fairchild Semiconductor.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see.Valentine: Which is why all the spinouts continued. Now, the reason I tell you thisanecdote about Bob in 1967 is because in 1969, two-and-a-half years later, heand Gordon announced they were leaving and starting a semiconductorcompany. So I called. I said, “I want to come see you.” He said, “I’d love tohave you join here in a minute. What are we going to talk about?” I said,“Two and-a-half years ago you told me it was too late to start a semiconductorcompany. I want to get your thinking about why two-and-a-half years later it’sappropriate. What’s changed?” Because our business is all about change.“Share with me what is happening in the universe that would cause you to dothis.” This was Intel in formation.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, right.Valentine: So, National was sort of a repeat of Fairchild Semiconductor in one sense. AtFairchild, at age roughly twenty-nine, I was running a sales force worldwidedoing $150 million in revenue. And what you like about that time and thatindustry is you got opportunities when you were young and when you couldimpose whatever creative ideas you had on a business—that was exceptionallydynamic. National, which was, unlike Fairchild, not a startup, was a publiccompany, very small, probably technically bankrupt. And a number of us wentthere and effectively created a company where there had been a staggeringcompany that was really destined to go out of business. The experience I gotthere was complementary to the experience I had at Fairchild, which was astartup. By the time it got to be 1971 I had had enough. I had learned, Ithought, all I was going to learn about silicon, all I was going to learn aboutthe semiconductor business. Having invented an entirely different structure inmarketing at Fairchild, I invented yet another structure at National. Now, I’vecarelessly used the word invented as though it had some kind of importanttechnological component, which is untrue and unintentional. It was just amatter of how you organize to do business at that particular point in time inthe world. And we formulated one at Fairchild which was very successful, andwe formulated a second one at National which was very successful.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why isn’t that invention?Valentine: To me, invention is what the people at Bell Labs do. They change thefundamental relation between one kind of material and another. They changefrom having a computer that would fill this room to where this giant computerbecomes a laptop—that’s invention. Anyhow, it’s a quibble. No one’s goingto buy the book for that reason. So, what’s happening? National is a publiccompany, the president of National is a manufacturing guy, a very good one.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Who was that?Valentine: His name was Charlie [Charles E.] Sporck. But, he was not a gifted publicspeaker, and he didn’t like to do it, and public companies have certainobligations forced on them by Wall Street to explain what you’re doing. And Iwas put into that role as part of the management’s explanation of thesemiconductor business and National’s position in it. I was approached bypeople in an organization, in the audience, who ran a very large mutual fundin Los Angeles called the American Funds or Capital Research andManagement. And they knew about my private investing, and they asked meif I would be willing to manage a pool of money dedicated to starting newcompanies. They would help organize it and raise it. One of the things I didnot do and didn’t learn from my diligence was there was a law called thePrudent Man [Rule], which basically said that the pension funds, theendowments and foundations, which is where all the money in the country is,were not allowed to prudently invest in venture capital.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because it was too risky.Valentine: Too risky. In those days they invested in bonds primarily; equities wereconsidered pretty risky. So that’s when I met Roger Kennedy. Roger Kennedywas running the Ford Foundation, one of the most high-impact managers andthink-tanks in the overall investment world in those days. Roger was theperson leading the charge to persuade the different entities in the governmentthat it was prudent to invest in stock. It was prudent to invest in stock incompanies in Europe, which was then unheard of.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: He was trying to change the rule?Valentine: He changed the Prudent Man Rule.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: 1978. And what was his argument?Valentine: [pause] I’m not sure Roger knew what argument that he had plied them withfor years finally caused the stars to line up right in a highly politicized world.How does the government make decisions now? Well, if anything, it wasalmost as complicated then in these areas. You had all of these guys sitting onboards somewhere who were eighty years old saying, “Gee, we can’t invest inWestern Europe.” I mean how long has Siemens been in business? A hundredand twenty years, and it’s too risky. They wanted to invest in bonds. Theydidn’t want to invest in stock.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, the late seventies is a period when the people in Washington, the policymakers, are getting worried about the United States losing out, particularly intechnology. The Japanese are going to do it all. I’m just wondering if theymade that leap: if we loosen up the rules here we’ll get people investing innew companies and maybe we have a chance to regain our superiority.Valentine: I’d like to believe that was a prevailing argument. I have no idea whicharguments were prevailing, but these mossbacks didn’t want you investing inthe biggest bank in London, never mind worrying about Toshiba. I think theywere so myopic about risk and the loss of dividends and the cash flowassociated with it, they were hard pressed to expand in any direction, andRoger was hammering on them since 1970. And progressively, this was notwhere you threw a switch and the law changed—this was grinding it outslowly; you made a little progress here and you could do that, and you madesome progress here and you could do this. But it was hell on wheels trying toget some relaxation. So if I ever needed a patron saint, Roger’s my nominee,because in some mysterious way he moved a mountain.And all of a sudden University of California was willing to give us money,Yale University was willing to give us money, Alcoa was willing. So a wholebunch of people who had been sitting on the edge of their seats to make moreaggressive investments with a very small part of their funds finally got a smallgo ahead, and people like us were able to start in business. Now, I did itdifferently. Guys like Pitch, Bill [William C.] Edwards. I’m trying to thinkwho was Pitch’s partner. Bill Bowes might have had an SBIC. They went tothe government. It was Bill Bowes, Pitch Johnson, Bill Edwards. Who wasPitch’s—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Reid Dennis?Valentine: Reid Dennis was at Fireman’s Fund, so he was in a different formation butcertainly one of the pioneers.Anyhow, a number of people went to a government agency called the SBA,the Small Business Administration, where there was funding available, fairlycomplicated forms, you were borrowing money and you worried about theinterest and all the rest of this stuff. I preferred not to do business with thegovernment, which has been my lifelong preference to never do business withthe government.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And spell out why.Valentine: Because they are unpredictable, irrational. For instance, if I take money froma pension fund, any U.S. pension fund, the Department of Labor can decidenext week that it’s a bad idea for American pension funds to be invested inilliquid categories and stop it. And I said, I’m not interested in being inbusiness where there’s a unilateral behavior potential. I want to be in businesswhere the decisions are made by rational people at Yale University.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] I’m thinking of Yale’s situation at the moment [huge portfolioloss in the recession].Valentine: Who is the guy who was the head of a U.S. bank [Export-Import Bank of theUnited States]? I can’t remember Bill’s last name.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [William H.] Draper.Valentine: Draper. He was another one who used the government SBA format. And myimpression is it worked fine for them. I don’t know anything about the details.I don’t know how it all worked. I just ruled it out as a category. You knowwho Willie Sutton is? Well, in a Willie Sutton orientation, you take the moneythat is in all the foundations in the U.S., all the endowments, all the mutualfunds in money management companies, and you probably have 85 percent ofthe investable funds in North America. So why go with the government? As apartner, they’re the partner of last choice from my point of view. It was thatsimple. I just went a different direction.Reid, as I think of it and maybe remember correctly, after he left theFireman’s Fund and raised a fund, his orientation was insurance companies.That might be because he was at the Fireman’s Fund for a while, and he wassteeped in the insurance business. They had lots of money, and I think Reidflourished by getting money from the insurance companies.So Sequoia was launched, thanks to Roger.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Really, you really hand it to him?Valentine: Well, he changed the law. Raising money was impossible under the prior law,and under Roger’s progressive relaxations of the law, raising money became arelatively simple and easy thing to do. Did you talk to [Thomas J.] Perkins?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes.Valentine: Well, you can confirm with Tom, because he and I raised money at the sametime, roughly speaking.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Right, you formed your companies at the same time.Valentine: And he didn’t go anywhere near the SBA, as I remember. He went the samedirection I did in the sense of—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: He told me that of all the well-known venture capitalists, he thought that hisstrategy was closest to yours. Would you agree?Valentine: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I don’t think the word SBA left his lips. I don’t think he was thinking of thatin particular. I think he was thinking of what we’ll presumably be getting to,namely operating experience and technical knowledge.Valentine: Well, I just thought of something and probably totally irrelevant. The peoplewho went to the SBA [tapping on table at mention of each name]: BillEdwards, Bill Bowes, Pitch Johnson, Bill Draper, all went to HarvardBusiness School. Tom Perkins went to Harvard Business School—overcameit.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [laughter] He liked Georges Doriot very much, though. He was invited to joinhis company and reneged.Valentine: I don’t know anything about that. When they were writing the Georges Doriotbook recently they called me for a comment. I told them I had no commentabout Georges Doriot; I never heard of him.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] Is that true?Valentine: He was never in the venture business that I recognized. He made aninvestment—one.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Right, American Research and Development Corporation.Valentine: Digital Equipment Corporation.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh, Digital, yes, right.Valentine: We made 750 investments.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, but he did precede you.Valentine: Never heard of him.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, you’re talking to an historian.Valentine: Historians sometimes magnify the impact of irrelevant events beyond theirutility.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [laughing] Well, so much for that category!Valentine: Right—moving right along.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: All right, so we’ve got Sequoia Capital founded. Now who’s there? Do youhave partners right away?Valentine: No.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Have you cut all your strings? I mean you’re not doing this part-time; you’vedropped National [Semiconductor]?Valentine: I left the semiconductor business, National specifically, in 1972.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, we didn’t talk about why that was. I mean why was this now the time?Simply because you thought you had opportunities because of what Roger haddone?Valentine: Didn’t know about Roger then until after I left National. I decided that I hadlearned all I wanted to learn in the semiconductor business. I had managedthrough a lot of the things that were interesting and useful. It was going to berepetitive continuing, and the people at Capital Research and Managementoffered me the opportunity of a startup, investing institutional money intechnology areas. So I decided to go in an entirely different direction.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was that somehow related to what you had been doing privately?Valentine: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I mean were you doing well? And you knew you were good at investing?Valentine: [pause] My struggle with the question is it’s an opportunity to be modest, andit’s unnatural for me to struggle being immodest.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [laughing] We’re not going to collapse if you actually are immodest.Valentine: When you’re starting companies it takes a while to know whether this is goingto work. And it’s one of the problems of building a firm like Sequoia, orTom’s firm, Kleiner Perkins. It takes a long time for a person to find, invest,and help a company achieve its natural success. It may be five years, it may besix years. So to say that I was successful, I don’t think I had enoughcompanies that I invested in in quantity, and they had not achieved enough inquality for me to be totally confident. In part, because I never had theresources to apply to these companies. As a company begins to succeed youhave to put more money into the proposition, and I didn’t have the moremoney to put into some of these companies. So their limitation was myinability to personally finance them.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see.Valentine: Whew!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But you must have been liking it at some level.Valentine: Yes!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You’re saying it was too soon in the game to know whether your investmentswere actually going to be successful—Valentine: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But there are other things that you were picking up.Valentine: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And you liked that, but tell me more.You made it clear that these things areconnected, but you were still veering off from the path that you’d been trottingalong. So there had to be something that was pulling you, or some things.Valentine: I had a sense that my system of selection would work far more than itwouldn’t. But I didn’t have the resources to play Texas Hold ‘Em and putmore chips up. The opportunity to have a large discretionary pool of money tocontinue to support the investment ideas was the difference in theenvironment I was in, and the environment I was interested in going to. And,after twelve or thirteen years in the semiconductor business, I had a very highprofile reputation in this community. So people who were interested instarting companies often gravitated to me to help them start their company.From their point of view I had some money, and I knew how markets workedand how to help them position their company in the market. So I had a bit ofan unfair advantage in those two respects. But the most unfair advantage I hadis I knew what the future was, and very few people knew what the future was.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You’re speaking of a technological future, right?Valentine: Right. Having been at Fairchild, Bob Noyce’s name is on the patent for themicroprocessor. All of these products work because of a microprocessor, and Iknew that was coming. Both Fairchild and National— Intel was started on thatpremise; that’s the conversation I had with Bob. I knew what the future wasand had a fairly good idea of when that future would begin, and I wouldfinance companies where that future played an important role. Nobody elsewas from the semiconductor businesses, nobody else knew marketing, andnobody else knew the microprocessor.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: The nobodies being the venture capitalists.Valentine: The venture capitalists, yes. So I thought I had a good leg up: sponsorship,money, unique experience, and a special awareness of the future.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And name recognition in—Valentine: The technical community.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes.Valentine: Here.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Which would be important.Valentine: Right, very. That’s why I didn’t have to know General Doriot.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] Yes.Valentine: I was going to work in the 408 area code, and he was somewhere, whereverthe heck Boston is.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, he was at Harvard.30Valentine: So that’s how Sequoia launched, and those are the underlying principles onwhich I was confident to start an entirely new business in an entirely differentarea.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What was the first investment?Valentine: Atari.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That was a pretty good one, wasn’t it?Valentine: Full of microprocessors.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, so what year would that have been? Let’s see, Sequoia was 1972.Valentine: 1975.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So did it take three years or so to raise that first fund?Valentine: Less than that. Took me probably a year and a half. It took me some time tofigure out areas I wanted to be in, markets that I hadn’t previously beenlooking at, and I chose Atari.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Games.Valentine: Games.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, but it was because of the technology behind it.Valentine: Because of the microprocessor running the games.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So that eliminates a lot of choices, doesn’t it?Valentine: It does. See, I eliminated a lot of things. Among the things I decided at thebeginning was— I used to tell this to our limited partners, and they used tolook at me like I was completely nuts, not just partially nuts. I would tell themthat the world is flat, and when you go east past Denver you go off the edgeinto a technical oblivion, and there are no companies out there worthfinancing. So I’m staying right here. On the West Coast. Frederick JacksonTurner. I want to see that Pacific Ocean in the morning. And I chose a wholebunch of rules like that to govern the area in which we make our moneyprimarily or initially because we select a good business. But it’s the value-addthat we at Sequoia give this company for five or six years. We help them, withour Rolodex, build all of the features and abilities into these companies thatthey don’t personally possess, and I can’t do that if it’s in Atlanta or if it’s inCleveland.[Paragraph Mr. Valentine added during editing]:The ground rules governing investment selection at Sequoia: must be a verybig market; must be in Northern California; must be in advanced technology;must have high gross margin ability; must have the potential for Sequoia tomake $100 m[illion]; must be positively responsive to our active participation.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So geographic proximity has to be part of the mix.Valentine: Rigid. It is now almost 2010. Give me the name of another city in NorthAmerica, any state you like, that has created 1 percent of the great companiesas around here.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, the only place that I guess would come close would be the Boston, MIT,Route128 region.Valentine: That’s right, and your careful phrasing is true. It’s the only one that comesclose. It hit its peak and zenith in the era of the minicomputer business. It isn’teven accurate to say it’s the second best place in the country. It’s notcompetitive with this [region]. So, going to Minneapolis from Cleveland,there are these places—you’re flying towards less than you’re looking downat.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So you didn’t see the point [of investing elsewhere]!Valentine: Gold was found twice in California.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Right.Valentine: In Mountain View, California.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It seems a perfect segue into all the mythology that’s grown up around SiliconValley. People talk about the obvious ingredients, but I’d like to hear yourtake on it. Do you have an interesting way of explaining why this particularpiece of geography has been so successful in this industry?Valentine: I have ten interesting ways, none of which, to me, are the answer. This is asubject that probably has opened more bottles of wine than any other singlesubject. Why did it happen here? Tony Tan [Keng Yam] was here at lunch onetime and asked the question. Tony Tan was then the assistant prime ministerof Singapore, and I said in answer to his question, it was luck. He wouldn’tbuy that. Try great universities. There are lots of places with greatuniversities, all over Europe; great universities in China. Why here? Whywhen it happened? Now, it’s called Silicon Valley for a reason. Silicon is themodern equivalent of petroleum for the unholy alliance made betweenStandard Oil and General Motors way back when. But now there’s siliconeverywhere—Japan, China, Texas, all over. Why? And I have to tell you that Idon’t think there is a single answer, even one that has multiple ingredients thatexplain it.One of the arguments that I think is very compelling is, once you get a successmomentum moving, the young people will leave Fairchild or Intel and go tothe next startup because of wealth creation. So you can throw into the mixstock options and an exceptionally vibrant stock market from 1975 to 1995 orlonger if you like to include a few more years. There are so many elementsaround which you can make a very, very passionate argument that none ofthem, in my opinion, stand alone. But in aggregate, nothing like it existselsewhere, or has ever existed elsewhere. Think about a Japanese man leavinga good job, starting a company that fails. He’d have to commit suicide. Welove to finance people who have tried and failed; they have really somethingto prove. Think of the rigidity of the Germans.A company we didn’t finance was up and running, made very good software.The founder of the company understood without any help that he didn’t wantto run the company; he wanted someone else to run the company. He was inSacramento; he was near an air force base. He hired a retiring colonel.[rapping the table] Now this is the typical software company—with dogs inthe building, bicycles in the building, everyone’s wearing jeans and t-shirts. Ihad this intuition about this colonel. And I said, sort of in the politicalframework, “What are you going to do for the first hundred days?” He said,“The dogs are out. Those goddamn bicycles are out. Those haircuts—we’regoing to look—.” I said, “Why? Why is that relevant? Who cares if there’s adog here, or twenty–two dogs? We’re in the software business. Why do youcare? The guy bought a bicycle that cost more than a car! He wants it [rappingtable] inside.” So it’s a matter of finding passion that’s connected to reality.The reality is, in a software company whatever happens happens. Andhaircuts, dress code— Has anybody seen Steve Jobs in other than jeans and ablack mock t-shirt in twenty years? [<|endoftext|>
Interviewer chuckles] It’s not relevant!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, it is relevant, but in the opposite way than what you’re describing.Valentine: Yes, that’s why big companies fail. See if Steve went for a job interview atHP, instead of starting Apple in 1978 when we financed it, he wouldn’t havegotten a job! They’d look at him and say, “You look like Ho Chi Minh.”There are relevant things that people do, and things that are just happenings ofan era.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Don’t you think that success is the background to all this? That you cantolerate anything, or virtually anything, as long as you’re building successfulcompanies.Valentine: Yes, and Tom [Perkins], if you ask him, turned down Apple because he metSteve and Steve was dressed the way Steve dresses. And he said, “Pfff. Thisguy doesn’t look professional.” He wasn’t. He was 19! He hadn’t gone toschool. He had sandals, jeans, and a t-shirt and a Ho Chi Minh beard.Atari—you go on the factory tour and the marijuana in the air would knockyou to your knees—where they were manufacturing the product. We hadboard meetings in a hot tub, with bottles of Ripple floating around the hot tub![<|endoftext|>
Interviewer chuckles] There are no rules that say that certain behavior produces aresult that’s directly related to the behavior. I think when you do that you getbig companies that die, like our automotive companies. They have so manyrules, so many things that they do and have long since forgotten why, that ittakes a different attitude. Now, I don’t go around advocating marijuanasmoking in the manufacturing area, but that’s the way Nolan [Bushnell] ranthe company.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You might have said something if the company wasn’t doing well.Valentine: Yes, but what would I say—get a higher brand of marijuana? Get a betterbottle of wine than is floating in the hot tub?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] Well, you would have pulled out.Valentine: There are a lot of opinions about why this place succeeded. And most of themare comparable—you compare them to other places. And the city I would giveyou, it has a few monuments nobody understands or gets, is Seattle. You havethe number one sports company in America, Nike. It’s a sensational company!You have Microsoft, of course, that’s sort of getting to the hardening-of-thearteries phase. And you have Amazon out there lurking. Pretty nicecompanies, small community, not famous universities but nice universities,generate a lot of engineers and everything, fabulous quality-of-life place ifyou don’t mind a little rain, or a little more than a little rain. But people loveliving there. No state tax.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Are you saying, but it’s still not Silicon Valley?Valentine: Yes, but if you’re looking for comparables, everybody always says, “Well,how about North Carolina and the Golden Triangle, whatever they call it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Research Triangle [Park].Valentine: Research Triangle. Nothing’s ever happened. State money, federal money,university money—show me the monuments! No monuments. Seattle hasmonuments. Seattle is not recognized, particularly, as a technology area.There’s no Harvard, there’s no MIT, but all of those places, wherever youwant to go, have produced nothing. And I don’t know why. I have no ideahow close Boston is to England, psychologically.Now one of the things I didn’t mention is that Silicon Valley has and hashad—we have a huge, huge continuous influx of Orientals. If you sat in ourlobby for a week, you would think we were a prejudiced employer becausethere are very few Caucasians. Huge numbers of Chinese, Indians,Japanese—you name the flavors of all Southeast Asia. And we have had themfor years. They are highly desirable to the engineering and sciencedepartments as graduate students and research fellows. And we have the dumblaw, protected by the Senate, that only allows a certain number of visas a yearto allow these people to come. I can’t believe senators are willing to sound sostupid in print, but they claim that they’re protecting American jobs. However,we’re talking about 30,000 people, all of whom have master’s degrees. Andthey’re here for PhDs. We don’t want you. You are going to take the job atMcDonald’s?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, the research universities are saying the same thing.Valentine: They want these people!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, of course they do.Valentine: And yes, they don’t all stay. But you have the benefit of their genius whenthey’re here. They make reasonable instructors, great researchers, et cetera.And we have our government fighting against attracting the best and brightest.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Are the two venture capital organizations [NVCA and WAVC] lobbying ordoing something to try to turn government policy around in this area?Valentine: I don’t know. I have to tell you that I never accepted an invitation toWashington, DC. I would never go there to lobby a senator.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And why?Valentine: I think the prospect of their listening and understanding—it doesn’t get themany votes! It doesn’t get them any contributions. “Why are you here to seeme?” These are not patriots who are in the Senate. These are low-IQ peoplewho have an agenda of staying elected. So no, I don’t talk to senators aboutthe obvious. If you don’t see it and get it, it isn’t a matter of Roger Kennedyexplaining a better world. If you don’t understand that 30,000 visas is nothingon a base of 300 million people—if we had 60,000 or 160,000 it would haveno impact on employment. If you have to explain things like that by traveling3,000 miles, I’m not your man!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] Shall we do one more question and then stop?Valentine: Well, if I like the question.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It’s a very practical one. At the beginning it’s just you, the way you’redescribing it, but with this whole network and set of experiences behind you.When and why do you decide to take on partners?Valentine: [Mr. Valentine added this paragraph during editing]:Adding new talent was and remains a continuous process: conventionaleducation was never a high priority. We look for people with functionalexperience in a startup, i.e., design and application engineering, productmarketing, sales, aspects of out-sourcing manufacturing. Our investmentdecision-making process requires very self-confident people—able to bechallenged publicly. At Sequoia, we all get credit and recognition forinvesting in Apple, Cisco, Google, and we all assume the mistakes of poorinvestment choices. We are team investment partners at Sequoia. We prideourselves on our differences and the methodology by which we develop ourindividual opinions. We have one acronym we are religious about:ROT—return on time. Most people are generally sensitive about the conceptof not throwing good money after bad. To us time is only invested where thereturn prospects do not require candles and prayers.The ability to manage a startup as an investor requires a huge amount of time.Our limited partners like the University of California or Yale would remind usthat you need more people to help these companies; you need people beyondjust yourself. If you want to have a larger fund, you need more people. If youmake five investments in the beginning each year, you’re accumulating allthese investments, there’s no liquidity events happening, so you end up withmaybe twenty companies. Impossible to provide them with the time andattention which they deserve. So you begin to look for peopleI look for people that are as far as possible different than I am, because we dothings here on the basis of consent among the partners. And I don’t likehaving a homogenized set of opinions. I want as much confrontation anddifferent thinking as possible. So we are slow and cumbersome making ourdecisions because we’re trying to find out everything that’s relevant. This is abusiness where the Socratic technique— First of all you have to figure out thequestions that are relevant, then you have to ask them. And you have tounderstand the answer in the context of what it is you’re trying to do. And youcan’t do that forever alone. It just requires more people.[Paragraph added by Mr. Valentine during editing]:Venture partnerships are very unstable—they blow up a lot. The building of apartnership is very hard, and the least difficult issue is compensation, which isover the top. It is a rare partnership that makes the transition to a secondgeneration of management. As an example, I have not managed Sequoia for atleast the last eight or nine years, and we have been better than ever. It is clearto me who our next managing partners will be. We have two now, and willhave two new ones within this decade. This stability is part of why we havehad the same limited partners for almost 40 years. Stability and returns is howSequoia is positioned.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: The fact that the limited partners were asking you to nurture these companies,I’m imaging it wasn’t because they had any particular interest in the welfareof the company. They wanted their investment protected, right?Valentine: Yes. They didn’t stress the idea of nurturing the company for the benefit ofthe company. It’s clearly nurturing the company for the benefit of their return.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, but where does that balance work out for Sequoia? Because your limitedpartners are staring you in the eye and saying, “Where’s this fabulous returnyou’re promising us?” So how much energy are you putting into making thesecompanies successful enough so you can get your money out, and how muchdo you really care about building a good company?Valentine: The different people—some are much more needy than others. Someone likeSteve Jobs, a completely uneducated individual, is one of the bestinterrogators that I have ever either seen or heard. Somehow or other he knewwhat to focus on and how to build a sequence and series of questions thatwere additive to the answers, sometimes from witnesses that were reluctant.We have other guys who fumble and stumble and don’t know their wayaround.One of my favorite stories— What happens in a conference room like this, wehave people come and pitch us for financing. And it’s storytelling—can youtell a story? Huge numbers of them have no idea how to explain theirbusiness. And they come in and they ramble on and on and on. So one daythere were two Sequoia people, three people from a company, and the guywas just making no sense, no progress. And I said, “Let’s have a timeout.Here’s my card. We’re going to come back in ten minutes and I want you towrite your business plan on the back of my card.” And he says, “That’simpossible.” And the other two guys on the team, clearly were loving this,because they didn’t understand it either! And we went away and [came back].You can imagine, the card was almost all ink. But he did an infinitely betterjob having thought about it, focused on the few messages he wanted to getacross that were not full of all this extraneous barrage of data but not facts.And it seemed like a cruel thing to do, and I didn’t do it for that reason, [but]because I wasn’t getting the pitch. And we have a concept around here calledROT, R-O-T [spells], and it means Return on Time. We can’t afford to havefour partners sitting in this room, and somebody explaining something, andI’m not getting it. Now it’s not we’re not getting it because it’s superscientific and we don’t understand it—it’s the storytelling technique. It’s thebuilding of the idea, the size of the market, the degree of the technical risk toget this product finished. Who’s going to care? And explaining that in a verysimple way, we can tell that that person is somebody we want to be inbusiness with. And it takes sometimes just lots of time, because he has noRolodex. He has never rented a building. He has never opened a bank account.I mean, the list of the things that you would think of that he has never done iseverything! Because he’s not been in business, and he didn’t learn how to doall that stuff.So finding Steve is rare. You have to overcome the shock of his appearance.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I remember reading that of all the people who you’ve met in yourcareer, that there were two people that you call visionaries. And one of them,as you might expect, is Steve Jobs and the other one was Bob Noyce.Valentine: That’s right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you see their talents as similar?Valentine: No, no. Steve is the brutal manager. He’s very smart. Bob was a very lighthands-on-the-steering-wheel manager, very, very brilliantly educated,fabulous scientific mind. One stupid habit—smoking. So they’re entirelydifferent and both work. Both systems and techniques of management work;but they work differently.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You call them visionaries. What does that mean to you?Valentine: That they had the vision. When we invested in Apple, the Apple computerdidn’t exist. Nobody had a personal computer. The cheapest computer was$250,000. And Steve’s vision was, we’re going to make them so thateverybody will have one. Pretty simple.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were you just dealing with Jobs? You weren’t worrying about [Steve]Wozniak?Valentine: The important questions were asked by Jobs. The important answers weregiven by Jobs. Steve Wozniak—and this is not meant to be a criticism—wasthe color commentator, if you understand the difference between the personwho watches and explains the play by play in the baseball game or the footballgame, and the other guy has the color on what just happened. Both werecritical to the operation. Neither could have been employed by a regularcompany because of the way they looked and the way they communicated.We at Sequoia are sometimes criticized for financing companies that areimpossible. The financing of Cisco [Systems] was— We financed two peoplethat were incredibly impossible, one of whom was a woman. They had a greatidea. In a sense, you can augment management, you can help them with morepeople that are highly qualified. And that’s why this [raps a book] is animportant thing for you to read—we invest on the size and dynamics of themarket. I don’t care if Genghis Khan is running the company; we’ll giveGenghis Khan some help. And give me a giant market—always. [Referring toLinda Norton at the camera] The whistleblower is silently whistling twoseconds.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why don’t we stop there?Valentine: Okay.[Mr. Valentine asked off-tape to orchestrate, uninterrupted, the beginning ofthe second interview.]Valentine: So the beginning that I intend to go through quickly is a 30,000-foot levelview of how I got from the university to the founding of Sequoia Capital andthe implementation of a technology investment program.We’re starting in 1954 when I graduated, got done with the formal educationalpart of my launch in life—and the focus always was a focus on science andspecifically electronics. As was customary in the mid-fifties, I did some timein the military, both at Fort Monmouth and Fort George Meade, both of whichwere technology bases on the East Coast. My entire duration at those sites wasinvolved in electronics, both studying it and teaching it.After the two years or so in the military, I moved on and joined an East Coastcompany by the name of Sylvania, with locations in New York State and NewEngland and Pennsylvania. I was at Sylvania, again in a totally electronicimmersion, from 1957 to 1959. I changed and briefly worked for Raytheon, asimilar kind of electronics company, although they were more oriented towardthe military than Sylvania, which was quite oriented towards consumerproducts like televisions. My stay at Raytheon ended in 1960, and this was amajor transition point in time.In 1960, I moved to California, which was a big change from living in theEast, and, second, I joined Fairchild Semiconductor, a startup companylocated in Silicon Valley. I began with Fairchild in Los Angeles, totallyimmerged in semiconductors, in electronics. I was with Fairchild from 1960,initially in Los Angeles, until 1962, at which time I moved to Mountain View,California, the heartland of Silicon Valley. In 1967, I moved from Fairchild toNational Semiconductor, another semiconductor company totally immersed inelectronics kinds of work.So very, very early in 1971, I decided to do something radically different. Idecided I had figured out and found what the future was going to be, both inspecifics in electronics, as well as where it was going to be. And it was goingto be in Silicon Valley, based on my experience in Mountain View,California. I started Sequoia Capital, very early 1972. Up until the present, aswe are looking at concluding calendar year 2009, we have been in thebusiness of starting companies, not totally focused in electronics, butoverwhelmingly focused in electronics. We have probably financed 700-oddcompanies, and using that round number, out of that 700 probably 670 wereelectronics companies, all of which were a natural selection and decision of40the prior years of being involved in, oriented, and committed to the electronicsfuture, which was just sort of beginning.It’s hard to remember, just thinking about 1960, that we didn’t have a lot ofthe things that are on the table [in this conference room]. There were nopersonal computers, there was no polycom telephone, there were nocalculators, there were no iPhones. None of that existed when I began theexperience of being in Silicon Valley. Now, we’re going to pause herebecause I’m having some trouble talking, so I need some lubrication.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] The tea that you like.Crawford: The coughing is picking up nicely [on the tape].Valentine: Yes, I’m good at it. I’ve been coughing since Thanksgiving.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh, wow.Valentine: So now is the time to question, from your point of view, because my streamof-consciousness interest is less structured, more detailed, but covers the sametime.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So do I enter in here?Valentine: I just gave you your line, and you’re supposed to dance onto the stage fromthe right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] Well, here I come. And I am on the right. I should have said thisat the beginning, but the monologue, which did not last fifteen minutes as youpredicted, was at your request. And that’s fine, because I think it reflectssomething about Donald T. Valentine.Valentine: We didn’t get to the monologue yet.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh, we didn’t?Valentine: All you had was the prelude foundation. We went from 30,000 feet, and nowwe’ll go down to ten feet.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well then, I would ask you to tie in that capsule history with what you thinkabout venture capital. You mentioned the heavy emphasis onelectronics—now why was that? And how could you predict the future? Let’slink all this stuff that’s happened to you in the past and makes you what youare now and had something to do with how you went about venture capital.Does that fit in with your free-wheeling?Valentine: Okay. Do have any other questions?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh, I have a lot, but let’s just deal with that first.Valentine: Because it’s easier to integrate them simultaneously than to go back.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well then, one of the things I really want you to talk about comes from thatconversation on the phone that we had when you were in Montana. And it’sabout your friend Lerasche and—Valentine: [William S.] Lerach.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Lerach, okay, hard ch, and how that incident applies to your policy aboutdocuments at Sequoia. I also have a lot of questions about how you go aboutinvestment. You know, why you do this, why you don’t do that.Valentine: You’re going to become a competitor?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: No. [chuckling] That was not in my mind.Valentine: These do not have to be historically perfectly linked because you’re going tocut and edit anyway, and you can put the Lerach story wherever you want it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: No, I’m not. Because the way we do our oral histories is that we keep themintact. We edit for clarity but we don’t move things around.Valentine: Oh really? Hmm.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It’s supposed to reflect how you think about things, not how I think aboutthings, although I realize my questions may lead you in different directions.Valentine: What led me to the conclusion that I made that’s wrong is the movie that I’malso working on, and it’s the same material. And they cut and paste whereverthey want the things. I mean I can talk about something and then they want togo ten years earlier and fifteen years later.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, well, they’re doing a different kind of documentation. They’re probablytrying to sell it to a major network and appeal to a general audience. We’retrying to get down history, some of which will be boring, but it presumablyshows how things evolved. Instead of sound bites, it’s a continual tape.Valentine: So we’ll put Bill [Lerach] in here. [pause] Okay, ready?Crawford: Taping.Valentine: This is at least advertised and intended to be a somewhat historic stream ofconsciousness. Unlike the prior observations at 10,000 feet or 30,000 feet, thisis going to be a lot more from my point of view, a key word kind of flow,because there are words that have evolved in the evolution and the creation ofSilicon Valley that are personally meaningful and probably meaningful to allof your other participants.We’ve started so that you understand the platform in California that I existedin and on was Fairchild Semiconductor, a very, very modern and advancedtechnology company that made products in 1960 that no one else in the worldmade. It was that company I selected to join in 1960, and I joined in LosAngeles in sales. The customers in those days were the major military andaerospace companies that existed and still exist in Los Angeles. They werebuilding then, and are building now, weapons systems that require veryadvanced capabilities in electronics. And that was my initial involvement inthe electronics industry in California. Circumstantially, it turns out that all ofthe users and customers were in the greater Los Angeles area, but all of thesemiconductor companies, like Fairchild, were in Northern California, whicheventually became identified as Silicon Valley.The company I joined was a startup and had a very difficult time gettingfinanced. The rather interesting—and this is one of those six degrees ofseparation kind of stories— The company was initially financed by ArthurRock, who is one of your other victims, and Arthur had a very hard timewas rare. It was the exception to the rule. All of the money in 1960, or the latefifties more accurately when Fairchild was financed, was in the East.Basically, Arthur found that no one was really interested in financing a whiz-bang science company 3,000 miles away with a whole bunch of people theynever heard of.So Arthur, creatively, contacted a man by the name of Sherman Fairchild,who was the chairman of a company in his name. His family, the Fairchildfamily, was at one point in time the largest shareholder in IBM. So it was afamily that knew about science, knew about electronics, was deeply investedin the premium electronics company in the world—IBM—and was veryfascinated by what the science was going on in Mountain View, California. SoFairchild was financed through a public company corporate vehicle. The nameof the company was Fairchild Camera and Instrument, and it was throughFairchild Camera and Instrument that we got financing. The interesting ironyis the president of Fairchild Camera and Instrument, with all of their assetsand entities in the East, happened to be—and I think it helped a lot—happenedto be a graduate of Stanford and had in his heart some historic interest in thearea and interest in the Stanford community.So, the company was off and running, financed, ’57 and ’58, and I joined andwas one of the early employees in sales in Los Angeles. The year endingbefore I joined the company had a few million dollars in revenue, so it wasreally a small startup company. The first year I was in the company in LosAngeles, and in the Los Angeles military complex, I sold personally more ofFairchild’s product than they had sold in the history of the company, andcertainly more than the prior year.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Are going to talk about what your approach was? How you could do that?Valentine: OK. There’s no special cleverness; there is no lack of interest on my part. Butthere are other parts of the history here that do have more innovation and morecleverness. It was just understanding what the customer’s technical problemwas, and understanding what the Fairchild Semiconductor solution was, andbeing able to explain to the customer what it was and how it worked. The waystartups work, it’s you have very few people but they’re all one extendedteam. And the person who ran Fairchild Semiconductor, who basically endedup with his name on the patent for the microcircuit—Bob Noyce. Thecustomers we were dealing with, the opportunities were so big, if I had atechnical problem that the customer couldn’t resolve and I couldn’t resolvewith them, Noyce would fly to Los Angeles and come see the customer. So ifthere was a secret, I had a genius as an application engineer.So because it was a startup and it was doing well, all the natural evolution ofpromotions, having joined in 1960, by 1964 I was the worldwide salesmanager for the company. And the company’s rate of doing business was now$100 million, and we were doing business all over the U.S. and in WesternEurope.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What was the scope of its operations when you joined in 1960?Valentine: Revenues in 1959 had been approximately $1 million.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Worldwide?Valentine: Same $1 million.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Fairchild had tentacles all over the world, even when you joined?Valentine: Oh, I’m not responding to the question you might be asking. I’m notresponding to what the sales were of Fairchild Camera, I’m only respondingto what the Fairchild Semiconductor division sales were. So you can say, priorto my arrival, they were zero, and by the end of 1964 they were $100 million.Now, you have to understand that in addition to there being very clever peopleat Fairchild, this product was spectacular. Once you could get the customer tounderstand it and how it worked, it was exceptionally easy to persuade themto buy. It was a matter of spending time with people who were dealing withthis kind of a solution for the first time in their life.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you find you had a natural facility for explaining technology?Valentine: Yes, that’s what all of the years [of experience] were. Because among thethings that I did in the military was teaching senior officers in the army howthese electronic systems would allow them to fight battles differently. It’s sortof amusing. When I encountered the military, the tanks—now this is clearlypost-World War II right, which was a tank war. The tanks were in a part of thearmy called the cavalry, sort of like John Wayne and horses and that kind ofstuff. The people who ran the cavalry, and therefore the tank corps, stillthought like John Wayne, and they had no idea how to use radar; they had noidea how to use the communication systems, which were very crude. Theywould stand up in the tanks and yell to one another. It was theircommunication system. Now, a tank has no muffler, so when you have tentanks going, it’s more sound than you can believe.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: The other obvious key here is you understood the technology. I imagine youhad to get up to speed in a specific product—Valentine: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: If it’s a very tight company, not only small but obviously communicating,that’s not going to be a problem either, right?Valentine: Right, and that’s what all of this quick 30,000-foot view explaining all thetime I spent in electronics and progressively higher orders of technologyallowed me to get to a point in 1960 where I understood things that werehappening and about to happen that other people didn’t know about.So, Silicon Valley, early mid-60s—an explosively exciting place. Newcompanies are forming, people are on the move going from one company toanother.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now how do explain that? It wasn’t called Silicon Valley, but you’re alreadymentioning that there were companies in Northern California. Why thissudden flowering?Valentine: The best answer to the question is I don’t know. The second answer to thequestion takes about two days to explain, at the end of which I’m not satisfiedwith my answer. [<|endoftext|>
Interviewer chuckles] What happened here has never happenedelsewhere in the world, in technology. If you take the automotive industry andgo back to 1900, Silicon Valley’s name then was Detroit. There were dozensand dozens and dozens of car companies, companies that made total cars aswell as companies who made fenders and parts and radios. You had a hugeindustry. The technology being created there was brand new, and there were alot of very brilliant people—Henry Ford—that established that part of theworld as the center. Now, I have no more idea why that [automotive industry]was chosen for Detroit, because nobody blows a whistle and says, “Okay,everybody move to Detroit.”What happens is, in the case of Silicon Valley, the universities attract differentkinds of people for their advanced education. One of the great advantagesSilicon Valley has always had is we have been very fortunate to have a hugepopulation of immigrants. I have to guess that something similar happened inDetroit, or any other technical revolution where something that didn’t existbefore suddenly became the way things were happening.If you just start in 1900 and do a fast study of the first twenty-five years ofDetroit, you’d probably find the similar kinds of phenomena that happenedhere. But I have no idea what the formula is, because people from all over theworld have been coming here trying to find out what the DNA sample is thatthey can take and go back to Sweden or South America or someplace andreplicate Silicon Valley. And no one’s replicated it, because no one’s figuredout the DNA. How important are the immigrants? Very. How important isBerkeley? Extremely. When I refer to Berkeley I’m talking about theuniversity. There were assets here that were here, and they were just exploitedin different ways by the people who came here.One of the very incredibly clever things that Stanford University allowed, ormaybe even beyond allowing, encouraged—they encouraged their faculty toget involved with the local technology companies: be advisors, be consultants,be on the board, participate. I’m trying to remember the name of the companyand I’m not succeeding. The current president of Stanford [John L. Hennessy]took a leave of absence about maybe fifteen or seventeen years ago. He wasthen one of the senior people in the management of the engineeringdepartment at Stanford, left the school on a sabbatical, spent about two ortwo-and-a-half years doing a start-up semiconductor company financed theway we finance all other companies. It was very successful; he made money;he came back to Stanford, went through the steps he was going to go throughjust two-and-a-half years later, and became the president. Lots of schoolsdon’t have that willingness to take the best and brightest and launch themoutside the university. And in the case of John, he did that.So that’s part of the environment. How important is that? Hard to weigh anyof the unusual features that exist here that you don’t find elsewhere, and hardto put a precise value on them and speculate if you didn’t have that capability,would the place have been that successful? So, as I warned you, it’s a verylong-winded, unsatisfactory answer about why Silicon Valley happened herewhen it did. It was just a confluence. Hewlett-Packard had already been here,Varian had already been here—Ampex. There were the beginning of majorcompanies in the technology business, and it didn’t happen overnight.I’m sure some clever marketing guy, whose name is Regis McKenna, came upwith the term Silicon Valley. Silicon Valley used to end, by the way, in midPalo Alto or even slightly north of mid-Palo Alto. It now goes down waybeyond San Jose. So it’s more of a state of mind to me than a geographichappening. It’s the can-do kind of place, in contrast to other places in theworld where there are lots of restrictions and things that are limitations.Anyhow, we’re rolling. As a result of the success, lots of companies started.There was a very hot stock market for IPOs; these are initial public offerings.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What era are you in?Valentine: We’re about 1964-65. Companies were going public left and right, net worthis being built famously. People are doing well, companies are expanding,companies are acquiring one another.A very clever lawyer, by the name of Lerach, figured out a terrific businessfor plaintiff lawyers. He would take the position that the companies that wentpublic did a number of things that violated the securities laws, and he wouldsue them.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Such as what kind of violations?Valentine: No, I don’t want to go into that. The violation that was most typical is that thesecurity laws are extremely complex, and they didn’t take the right number ofcautious steps to be in compliance with different laws that had been on thebooks. Mainly, what Mr. Lerach wanted was a hunting license. He wouldwrite up a very small, vicious brief, submit it, the suit was launched againstthe company and its directors, and what he wanted was the ability to dodiscovery. He wanted his lawyers and himself to be able to go into thecompany’s records and find out what they did right and what they did wrong.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was this new in the law?Valentine: Yes. It was new in the way law was practiced, in the exploitation byindividual plaintiff lawyers, that you’d sue and find out the facts later. Thelawsuit was based on what they found in the company’s records. Very earlyon a number of us recognized the threat that Lerach and company representedbecause they were suing the directors of the board, the venture capitalists, aswell as the management.So, at this point in time, early 60s, mid-60s, we had disk drives. We hadability to store records so it wasn’t paper. To me, storing pieces of paper infiles is a complete waste of time. I outlawed files [at Sequoia]; I outlawedstoring pieces of paper. We basically were trying to be more efficient, andalso to not have any information that would potentially help the Bill Lerachsof the world and the plaintiff lawyers as a category.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now this was a policy as soon as you founded Sequoia?Valentine: No, it happened a little later, because when I founded Sequoia the cost ofthese kind of memory systems was more expensive than they’ve proven to be,and I wasn’t as sensitized to how useless is the filing system in Americancompanies. Somebody will have a piece of paper come across his desk, and hedoesn’t really know what to do with it. So he writes a little note on it andgives it to his assistant and says, “File this.” So you have a useless piece ofpaper, now in folder, that nobody understands the title of, and you’d neverwant to retrieve it anyway because you couldn’t, because she has no idea whyshe filed it where she did. So the whole concept of filing was a hugemonumental cost and waste of time. So I outlawed it, and it turned out—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But [you were also reacting to] the Lerach situation?Valentine: That was a confirmation of a good decision made previously. There’s no pointin having files, regardless of whether there was a plaintiff law firm outhunting. So everything we do, every investment we make, there’s a law firminvolved of our choice. The law firm is involved in writing all of thedocuments. So they’re written in a particularly arcane language that only thelawyers can understand, and they memorialize all of this stuff the same wayfor each IPO. So why would we need a file? The have it in their file. We can’tread it anyway because they’ve written it in a code. So my position was keepthe paper there; I don’t ever want it here. That was one of the otherconvictions about why not to have files: someone else already had them.Every year we’re audited. Well, the law requires the auditor to have a file. Sohe has our audit record and the supporting statements in his file. So we don’tneed to have any of that stuff.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, that’s true for activities with a strong legal basis. But what about thepartners sitting around a table trying to figure whether to invest or not? Isthere no documentation of things like that?Valentine: Very, very little. There are papers that are created prior to each investment. Atthe end of the investment cycle, we say yes or no. In both cases we throw thepapers away.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Really! But at times that must screw you up, right? You’re really reliant onthe human memory, which we all know is very fallible.Valentine: No, because these things are highly regulated; there are laws governing thesethings. There’s a law firm and an accounting firm that we hire on eachtransaction; they have the records. In the case of the law firm, we can’t readthe damn writing anyway! So there’s no point in having it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How pervasive is this sort of philosophy?Valentine: No idea.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes.Valentine: No idea.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You think that some venture capital partnerships are still keeping records inthe same old-fashioned way?Valentine: I hope not. It’s just a waste of money.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, and, as you’re implying, opening yourself up to legal problems. Wereyou ever sued by Lerach?Valentine: I used to know the answer. I have been sued at least ten times, ten differentcompanies. The lawsuit was the same violation of security rules—whateverthat is. Three times I’ve been sued by Bill Lerach. One time he did thedeposition in person, and at one point in time my name and the Sequoia namewere on his Web site as examples of people he sued a lot.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How did that make you feel?Valentine: If I took things like that seriously I’d have felt like, you know, kind of publicenemy number 104, or something. It was extortion—my word; I think otherpeople agree that it’s an appropriate word. Nobody ever did anything wrong.Ten lawsuits—there was never a trial, because what happens is, the plaintifflawyers have figured this out. In one of these typical small venturecompanies, there may be six or eight people on the board: some of the officerswho run the company, some of the people like me that finance the company,and some outside directors who bring special expertise. The lawsuit goes onfor a while, without the board being involved, because the lawyers are doingwhat they call discovery. Our lawyer and Lerach are discovering what thefacts are.At some point in time, after they grind up enough hours that you have to paythem for, they hold up their hand and say, “$7 million is what it takes to settle;we want $7 million.” And they’re representing shareholders. They get 30percent of the $7 million, so their ask, their extortion ask, is $7 million. We ofcourse have had an insurance policy in place all the time, and early on wefound out that Lerach, the plaintiff lawyer, and the insurance company—andpossibly our lawyer—have been talking about what the extortion numbershould be: $7 million is the answer. We have a fully paid-up [insurance]policy that says $10 million. So, “Okay, we agree. We’ll give you $7 million.”And the insurance company says, “Not so fast. If you agree that the damagesare $7 million, we will only pay $4.5 million.” And you’d say, “Well, wait aminute, we’ve been paying insurance on a policy for $10 million.” “Well,we’re not convinced that $7 million in damages have happened, so we’d liketo have more lawyering go on, but we’re not going to give you $7 million.”50So I go from this room, with the insurance company that I thought was on ourside, to the next room where our lawyer explains it. Then I go into the nextmillion. It’s ridiculous.” So we have that conversation. And no one’s on yourside! Everybody’s getting paid except me, right? All the lawyers get paid bymillion to settle, and the insurance company is only going to give a little morethan half.And that’s how everything ends—never a trial. Bill Lerach does not want todo trials. He just wants to put a little fear into the directors. He wants to bleedmillion, with partial coverage by the insurance company.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So you couldn’t do any better with the insurance company?Valentine: No, we tried changing insurance companies—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because this figure is just pulled out of the air, right?Valentine: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So how do you prove or disprove it?Valentine: You have more lawyer hours engaged.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] To say nothing of your time.Valentine: Yes, I’m the only person not getting paid!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes.Valentine: Let’s end this!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: This happened ten times to you?Valentine: Ten times.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why did Lerach go to prison?Valentine: I have to tell you that in my thirty-odd years of investing, I’ve come across alot of very smart people. Unfortunately, Mr. Lerach is one of them.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Right along with Bob Noyce?Valentine: Well, no not in that class. But Lerach created a business in which he and hisfirm, and other plaintiff law firms, made hundreds of millions of dollars a yearin revenue for their law firms. Lerach was a huge donor to the DemocraticParty, and he used to stay in the White House. He was a guest of the president.So, you know, I’m not dealing with some Podunk lawyer who has noconnections. Huge amount of wealth, but he got careless.The plaintiff lawyers represent the shareholders, and what happens is theyhave so many complaints they list the plaintiffs alphabetically. Well, yourname was first, your name was second, your name was third—in lawsuit afterlawsuit after lawsuit after lawsuit. So finally one of our lawyers asked me sortof jokingly, “Do you know any of these people? Are they suing you onpurpose, personally?” Well, it turns out they just had a list of people that wereprofessional plaintiffs, and they got careless, and they didn’t change the listand didn’t tell the people they were plaintiffs. So what our law firm did is theywent after the plaintiffs, and they deposed the plaintiffs and found out, “Well,God, I’ve never heard of this company. I’m not suing them.” So the law firmswent after Lerach’s company because he was now in violation of the securitylaw.Before I ruin my entire day we have to get off Lerach. But the conclusion ofthe story, and it’s one of those only-in-America possibilities, Lerach andcompany agree, “We’re guilty.” Now we’ll negotiate the fines and thepenalties and the prison time. So they do all of that stuff, and [sighs] it’s sucha highlight day in my life. I found the record. When he was being sentenced,the judge said, “Mr. Lerach, there are three prisons, and you may chooseamong the three prisons which one you go to. We’ll arrange so you can visitthe prisons, meet with the head of the prison, and find out which prison youwould, such as you can prefer, to be in.” And I thought to myself, Jesus!Where’s Wyatt Earp and those kind of guys when I need them? So he goesand visits these prisons, and he makes a choice, and he wanted to be sure hisprison suite had a southwest view and— Oh my God! I couldn’t believe it.Anyhow, no more on Lerach; that’s the end of the Lerach story.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: All right, so where are we in your story?Valentine: We’re in the mid-sixties, and Fairchild was phenomenally successful andbecame the fountainhead for spinouts: people leaving; people going to starttheir own companies. And this was about the period of time when all kinds ofcompanies were being started. I started financing them personally, makingsmall investments in a small number of companies where I knew what thescience was and—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Just from money that you had saved?Valentine: Yes. So you have a company now, 1965, public, $150 million in sales, hugebrand name—one of the biggest brand names in the business. All kinds ofcompanies were starting around us, and I began financing using an approachderived from the way we made engineering decisions. 1967—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I don’t understand what you said just then—a derivative approach?Valentine: Business was so good that we had more opportunities than we had engineers,and we devised a bit of an ad hoc technique for evaluating differentcompanies before we would commit our engineering resources to work withthem on a specific project. We had to understand the nature of the applicationand understand the size of the market. There are a number of highlight kind ofthings that we did before we committed engineering. Having evolved thatsystem, I used the same system to make small personal investments incompanies that were all physically located here and where I understood thescience. And it was probably as much a hobby as not, because I would makemore money on Fairchild’s stock than I would make in any of theseinvestments, because I didn’t have enough money to support too manycompanies at the same time. So it was an interesting, highly useful hobby.We went on, in 1967, to another semiconductor company—and my lastcompany—somewhat similar to Fairchild Semiconductor, not as good atscience as Fairchild Semiconductor, and this was a turn-around. This companyhad existed prior to us. It had been financed incorrectly; it had the wrongmanagement, and the investors didn’t understand the semiconductor business.And we went in acquiring this—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Investors being code for venture capitalists?Valentine: Yes, not all venture capitalists are smart; a lot of them are pretty dumb.Geography matters. This company was financed by venture capitalists in theEast, and the company was in Connecticut. I don’t know much aboutConnecticut, and I have no prejudices against Connecticut, but there isnothing happening there. In the immortal words of Gertrude Stein, there’s nothere there. Here is where you do semiconductor companies, there is whereyou make nutmeg or something different. So we basically took over thecompany and restarted it using local Silicon Valley people.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, do we have a principle right there in that example? It sounds to me asthough your Connecticut people are acting like an investment banker or aWhitney or a Rockefeller. They have a lot of money; they want to make more.But they’re not interested in building companies, particularly, so they just putmoney in, and they’re sitting in Connecticut hoping it works out, yes?Valentine: Yes, I think that’s a very good summary. One of the strengths that I’vepersonally had, and Sequoia has had, is the benefit of being in the center ofthe universe at the right time. And the center of the universe was here and notin Connecticut. And one of the principles that we followed at Sequoia sinceforever, is that we only invested in Silicon Valley; we only invest in the WestCoast. We made very few investments in San Diego. We’ve made noinvestments in Seattle for the first thirty years. It wasn’t that there were badcompanies there; it’s we had more than we needed here.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Right.Valentine: And since we’re very hands-on in our investing, we needed access. Manyother people in the venture business invest everywhere. It doesn’t matter tothem. I don’t know how they do that; I wish them well. If I find a goodinvestment in Lexington, Kentucky, I’ll call someone and tell them. “It’s allyours.” I don’t know where Lexington is, and I don’t want to learn.So, National [Semiconductor] experience was the end of my education. I hadlearned, in my opinion, all there was to learn at Fairchild, in a startup, and I’dlearned all I had to learn at National in a turn-around. I’d always run sales andmarketing in these companies, so I became fairly proficient at sales andmarketing in the creation of different solutions, which were unique at the timebut highly advantageous to the specific companies.All of those experiences made it comfortable for me, when I was approached,to join an effort to raise money and finance startups. If you just take 1970,because it’s an easy year, there were very, very, very few dedicated funds forventure capital in the country. It didn’t matter where they were. I think thatwhen we raised money by accident—Tom Perkins was raising money at thesame time—there was probably less than $50 million dedicated to thiscategory of investing in the whole country. So it was a very embryonicbusiness, very, very few practitioners, and money was hard to raise.[interruption][End Audio File 3]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I’ve lost track of where we are, to tell you the truth.Valentine: We have gotten through to the beginning of Sequoia.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: All right.Valentine: So in the early seventies, in the first round of raising money, and it was veryeasy to decide where and what to invest in. Initially, it was difficult to raisemoney because the money was all controlled by the East, and they had noexperience, really, in taking the money from different endowments or pensionfunds and putting it in these kinds of illiquid investments. So we came up witha sufficiently attractive platform that was successful in getting investorsinterested.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: This is the first fund?Valentine: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How much did you raise?Valentine: Five million dollars. And we were going to invest in technology companies,only on the West Coast, that were addressing big markets. We were interestedin building major companies; we were not interested in being in theinvestment business, which is different than building companies. We wantedthe money to come from tax-exempt sources, so we decided never to haveindividuals.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now explain the thinking behind the tax-exempt sources.Valentine: Well, most of the money in North America is tax-exempt money. It’s youruniversity or it’s a foundation or it’s a pension fund. So in going after taxexempt money, you’re going after the majority of the money. They just havesome sensitivity about how it’s invested, so that their position as being taxexempt is not at all ever threatened. So we were going at what we presumedwould be the largest sources.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see.Valentine: Having hammered out the concepts that we were going to follow—and one ofwhich was geographically limited. We didn’t think we had to go to Texas; wedidn’t think we had to go to North Carolina. We thought there’d be enoughinvestable opportunities here that we could get returns that would be veryattractive to them. So the large pools of tax-exempt money were happyreturning 10 percent a year. And what we thought we could do was more thantwice that. We thought we could deliver 20 to 25 percent compoundedannually.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now what gave you that confidence?Valentine: In a word? Naïveté. The investments that I had made personally achieved thateasily. I was interested in finding a standard which they, first of all,recognized. So 8 to 10 percent was a terrific standard. In your endowmentworld, the universities normally are limited to taking 5 percent of theendowment annually to run the institution. So they had this goal of 10 percentcovering their annual 5 percent need. I just made a value judgment that said ifwe deliver twice their objective, we will have long-term lots and lots ofinterested people or entities willing to have us finance startups using theirmoney.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now, were you going to institutions with which you had a previousconnection?Valentine: No.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why?Valentine: Because there were no institutions that I had previous connections with. Thenature of Fairchild Semiconductor’s customers were divisions of giantaerospace companies. And we never did business at the level of the presidentor the chairman. So it was, initially, without those contacts.I have to tell one story because I’ve always enjoyed it. I went to see somepeople in New York—that’s where the money was—who were at a companyby the name of Salomon Brothers. And I went there largely because a friendof mine was very convinced—Berkeley graduate—that I could do what I saidand that Salomon Brothers should be an investor. This is the investment worldof New York, Manhattan. All of my prejudices, I’m sure, were blinking likelights in their face. And we went through a little pitch, and we got to thequestions. This one guy—he had all of the documents in front of him—hesaid, “You didn’t go to Harvard Business School.” And I said, “Right. I didn’tgo to Harvard Business School. I went to Fairchild Semiconductor businessschool.” [<|endoftext|>
Interviewer laughs] He had no sense of humor, didn’t find that at allfunny, and said, “We’re not going to invest with anybody who didn’t go toHarvard Business School.”I said, “You could’ve saved me a lot of time, because there’s no way I’mgoing to tell you I went to Harvard Business School, because I haven’t and,parenthetically, never have had any interest.” I said, “You know, I’m fromanother part of the country, which I think to you is like a different planet.”And that was the end of the conversation with Salomon Brothers.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I can imagine that it was!Valentine: There’s a lot of preconception in the investment community. This was after Iexplained to them I’m not in the investment business; I’m in the business ofstarting great companies. He was not able to make a distinction outside hisboundary prejudices.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I think it was off-tape that you told me last time with some pride that nobodyat Sequoia—maybe you qualified it a little—had a Harvard business degree oran MBA, period. Is that more or less correct?Valentine: That is more or less correct historically. We began with the opinion that wewanted to have people who knew how to start and run businesses. There wasnothing to be learned at any business school in learning how accountingworked and things like that. Those were things that you hire people to do. Youdon’t hire people to start and run the company; you hire people to doaccounting. All people, initially, were like me. No one went to businessschool. Many of us went to the Fairchild Semiconductor business school orsome other technology school. And I suspect that we do have MBAs aroundhere. It’s the second greatest crime; the first greatest crime is a lawyer. Wedon’t have any of those around here, because I’d have them nailed up in thelobby.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] You realize that Caroline [who is filming] is married to a lawyer.Valentine: Yes, I just discovered that, based on her response.Crawford: He’s a good lawyer!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] Exactly what I was going to say. He’s an environmental lawyer.Valentine: Yes, well, not knowing your husband, my next observation obviously isn’tpersonal. But there was once a president in this country, back in the earlydays, who said, “The only good Indian is a dead Indian.” Well, just change theIndian to—Crawford: Got your metaphor.Valentine: So.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, may I ask you something about not having a business degree? I agree,and it seems reasonable that you would hire accountants, et cetera,presumably one has to anyway. Isn’t part of the due diligence that youpresumably value, doesn’t that mean going over the financials?Valentine: No.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: No? So why not?Valentine: [sigh] Well, let me make a point of clarification. Most of the time we invest incompanies that have no sales. So there are no financials.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Right.Valentine: So going over them—it’s a matter of looking at a fantasy that the entrepreneuris trying to persuade you is the future. And it’s done by a computer, so thenumbers all foot. There aren’t any math errors. So what you do is you listen tothe man’s vision of what the future is going to be, knowing after making acouple hundred investments that he’s very optimistic or he wouldn’t bestarting a business. So no, we don’t spend any time looking at the financialsbecause we know they’re wrong. We don’t need somebody who’s an expert atthat since we don’t look at them. Now we look at the financials from a coupleof points of view, one of which is: what’s the gross margin of the product?Very critical. What is the burn rate on cash? So there are things that we lookat that are forecasts of what’s going to happen.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You mean burn rate that is occurring or will occur?Valentine: Will occur. See everything—everything is the future.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How do you calculate that?Valentine: Numbers. All of the costs in a startup are people, right? So we start a companyand we need nine engineers. So we hire nine engineers.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, you need a place to put them.Valentine: Yes, and we know what that costs. And they need some laptops, and we knowwhat that costs. If you do it long enough, you just double the cost of the nineengineers, and you’re close enough to what the burn rate will be. The issue islistening to their answer, and if it’s less than two times the engineers [cost],we know maybe they’re a little aggressive with their numbers. If it’s muchmore than two times the engineers, well, maybe they’re not so good atmanaging costs. But we don’t need anybody to do that for us. We’ve done thatin running companies. So what we have when we start with the format ofpeople’s backgrounds that we have chosen is, we have people who know howto run businesses. They’ve run businesses. Let me just ask you a question. I’mtrying to remember who else you’re interviewing. Pitch?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes.Valentine: Tom [Perkins]?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes.Valentine: Reid [Dennis]?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes. Bill Edwards.Valentine: Three Harvard Business School graduates.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] There are a lot more of them.Valentine: Yes, so I don’t want to leave you with the impression that my prejudice isanything more than a prejudice. Are you doing Arthur [Rock?]?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, I’ve interviewed him.Valentine: Arthur graduated from Harvard. So you have a predominant number of peoplethat you shared with me that are Harvard graduates, Harvard Business Schoolgraduates. So you can conclude a couple of things. One is that it’s not ahandicap. Graduating from Harvard Business School is not a negative. It maynot be a positive either, but it’s not a negative, because all of those guys aresuccessful. Is Bill Bowes on your list?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes.Valentine: So you have a ton of Harvard Business School guys and varying degrees ofsuccess. Unless there are people on your list I don’t know about, I’m ananomaly.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, you are.Valentine: And I’m not from Harvard Business School, so it shows the business is suchthat it can be done by a lot of different people with different backgrounds,including fundamentally different educations. That’s my plug for HarvardBusiness School.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: The way you got to venture capital is very different from the way TomPerkins—well, he isn’t a good example because he did come up throughtechnology.Valentine: Yes, Tom is more similar to me than dissimilar. All the other guys are verydissimilar.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You spent some time today explaining the prelude to Don Valentine asventure capitalist. It looks to me as though there are many ways of doing this.A lot of it boils down to the native and acquired abilities of the individual.Valentine: I agree. See, venture capital is very reducible to a few words. You have to beinterested in managing change, and you have to recognize that change isnecessary.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That’s an interesting idea that nobody else has talked to me about. So what areyou thinking about when you say managing change? What change? Whatchanges—I imagine there are many.Valentine: Today’s solution is wrong for tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You mean technology.60Valentine: Yes, but it’s applicable to a lot of other things. It’s just that it’s harder tounderstand because [other] things don’t change fast enough. Technologychanges rapidly, so you’re able to see it very quickly. The evolution ofhandheld computers has happened in three years, and you have unbelievablygood products right now that were not conceivable four years ago. Peoplenever would have agreed that you’d have something like the iPhone.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: When you talk about managing change, in this case managing technology, areyou meaning within the company? The company can’t just make a goodproduct and sit back. You, the board, whomever, has to be always severaljumps ahead, I’m imagining, in order to anticipate how technology ischanging or perhaps should be stimulated in this company to change. TheiPhone is here. What’s next? Who does that?Valentine: People that I find, people that are immigrants, people that are just in schoolnow. Let me work at answering your question from an angle. Ten years ago,there was a product on the market, only one of its kind. They had basically100 percent market share. Anybody who wanted to listen to music while theywere moving had a Walkman. Did you ever have a Walkman?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: All my kids did.Valentine: You ever have a Walkman? [Directed to Caroline Crawford.] Right. So youhad a cassette, and it was all there was, so it was spectacular. And Sonyowned the market. There were no competitors of any consequence in theworld. The technology was fairly simple. The biggest part of their success wastheir distribution system. But just as recently as three-and-a-half or four yearsago, a local company by the name of Apple eliminated the Walkman foreverwith a radically different product. So you didn’t have one song—you have athousand songs.That’s what I mean about embracing change. You have to recognize that whatyou have is not the end; it’s not the limit. When you can’t do that change fromthe Walkman to the iPod, you become like General Motors. You cannotdevelop anything new. General Motors, in a very short period of time, losttheir role to a Japanese company by the name of Toyota, who did embracechange.[Paragraph Mr. Valentine added during editing]:Change happens everywhere—only the rate of change differs. The basicenergy creating and recognizing change comes from the entrepreneursexploiting base technology. We financed a shoe company—no technology atall. It was just acquired for $1B. The company’s business is selling mostlywomen’s shoes over the internet, no stores—Zappos.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: In many cases you are sitting on the board, right?Valentine: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What do you do to stimulate a company if you aren’t satisfied with where itis?Valentine: It’s a matter of starting with the conviction that that’s the right course ofaction. I don’t know what the position is of the dozen people you’reinterviewing, but it wouldn’t surprise me if a small number of them would notwholeheartedly agree with just randomly embracing change, deciding that thepast was wrong for the future. And that’s why companies lost momentum.Think about why it’s very difficult in this country to have a company with $50billion in sales. They die before they get to $50 billion in sales. They don’thave any new products.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why?Valentine: Risk.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: One measure of success is the growth of the company, right?Valentine: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But the downside of that is the bigger you get, the tendency is to build ininertia. What really happens to companies after they’ve gotten off the groundand have enlarged? Why can’t they keep that earlier culture?Valentine: You know, I have an answer that I’ve developed largely because it’s a funanswer. I’m not sure I know the real answer. But to me, the most dangerousthing that happens in a company when it starts and it’s going along well: youstart an HR [human resources] department, and the people in the HRdepartment want to level the playing field. I mean, they are communist atheart. They basically want everybody to have the same medical program,everybody to have the same parking place, everybody has the same, same,same, same, same, same, same. Their purpose there—and they’re not aware ofthis— They have binders [of policies] and you suddenly are regimented as acompany into categories of people. They’re not interested in change—they’reinterested in sameness. So they legislate by accident, not hiring people whoare strange and want to make change. They want obedient people. And withobedience you get no innovation, because it’s disobedience that gets you theinnovation—someone who doesn’t believe what’s going on is the limit.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you say this sort of thing in board meetings?Valentine: Fearlessly.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And how do people react?Valentine: Stunned. Because you’re attacking one of the cows that has become, or is inthe process of becoming, sacred. All companies are told—God, you’ve got tohave this HR policy and all this great stuff so your employees will love you. Idon’t want them to love me. I want them to work their asses off coming upwith new products. [<|endoftext|>
Interviewer chuckles] So there are things that unintentionallytake all of the momentum out of the company. And the company’s agendabecomes defocused. So they’re not interested in knocking Sony out of thatWalkman socket. They have other agenda, whatever they are, wellintentioned, perfectly good agenda, good for the country, good for the state,but it ain’t good for the company.Historically we [in venture capital] have always been the effort to changethings. And that’s how you build great companies. You have to do thingsdifferently. Why does the automotive industry fail? And the simplistic reasonseems to be the labor unions. Sounds good to me. All I know is they’ve failedas an industry to innovate. And I’m very inclined toward a conspiracy theorythat was started way back when between the first car manufacturer and thefirst petroleum supplier. The internal combustion engine was designed tomake the world work for those two companies, and it did. And it’s wonderful,except we forgot: how do we keep going?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: May I ask you a question?Valentine: I’m done.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: We sort of got into it last time, but I’d like to hear it more explicitly. I believeyou said something to the effect that some of your colleagues in venturecapital, and successful ones, put a lot of credence in the person, in theentrepreneur. And you said something to the effect that that’s not the way yougo about it; that you look at market. Would you expand on that? And wheredoes the person come in?Valentine: Well, just to frame the question the way it normally is: for years, largely forentertainment purposes, debates were staged, in significant part, with ArthurRock and myself. Arthur Rock is the representative of, you find a greatentrepreneur and you back him. And my position has always been, you find agreat market and you build multiple companies in that market. How are theydifferent? Obviously I have to have, in my companies, the same kinds offunctions that Arthur has. So I need to have a president, and I need to have asales manager, and I need to have a head of engineering. I think the differenceis that my articulated position recognizes that choosing great people is very,very hard. All these people who come with great credentials—and I’ll talkabout one at the end of the story—and often don’t work out. So presidents inSilicon Valley are changed 50 percent of the time, five-O, 50 percent of thetime.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Wow.Valentine: And that’s by people who start with great people. I start with whomever, andstatistically we’ll replace our presidents less than 50 percent of the time. Butwhat I want is a big market. The expression of a big market is some kind of aproblem which when it’s solved provides you with a very special opportunityto have massive levels of sales in that solution. [pause] [sigh] I have to thinkabout this for a minute—because this is for posterity.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] Be careful.Valentine: Right. I think his name is [G.] Richard Wagoner, the currently deposed chiefexecutive of General Motors, was in the community within the last severalweeks, traveling around Silicon Valley. I was asked if I wanted to see him,and I said, “No, I have no interest in seeing him. Why is he here?” I asked.“Well, he’s getting acquainted with Silicon Valley, and he wants to see ifthere are any companies or industries that possibly he could help.” And Ithought to myself: based on what goddamn experience is he going to helpthem? [<|endoftext|>
Interviewer laughs] I mean he put General Motors out of business!Anyhow.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So you did not go.Valentine: Why? I’m not an autograph collector. So our view has always, preferably,been give us a technical problem, give us a big market when that technicalproblem is solved so we can sell lots and lots and lots of stuff. Do I like to dothat with terrific people? Sure. Are we unwilling to invest in companies thatdon’t have them? Sure. We invested in Apple when Steve Jobs was abouteighteen or nineteen years old— not only didn’t he go to Harvard BusinessSchool, he didn’t go to any school.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] He went to Reed for one year.Valentine: It’s not relevant. He knew the future of a business that is gigantic. And youcan say, retrospectively—well, lots of people knew about the personalcomputer. That’s a bunch of baloney! The product of choice, when Steve wasnineteen, cost $250,000 and probably a master’s degree in IT [informationtechnology] to operate it!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] I can believe; I can believe. Well, so here’s your marketingbackground coming in again, right? Your marketing background, being able toassess where the need is going to be and how big the market’s going to be,right?Valentine: Yes. But why would I want to do that? See? And the answer in marketing isdata. So you can get independent data and analyze it and slice it and dice it ina lot of different ways and come to any number of conclusions. When you’rehiring someone or interviewing someone, it’s totally your instinct to deal withthe answers he provides that live up to his credentials. A lot of people, I’mtold, would be delighted to have Mr. Wagoner on their board or something.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But that’s surely just name recognition, isn’t it?Valentine: I have no idea. See, I would never do it. There’s no amount of money hewould have to pay the company to be on one of our boards. So the nuancesthat surround this easy articulation of a distinction are more important than theobvious gross distinction. I love doing business with bright, smart people. Iwouldn’t go out of my way to not go into business with them. But if themanagement is a wreck, it’s called Cisco [Systems], because when weinvested in Cisco we were the only people that would invest in Cisco.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because of the management?Valentine: Because of the management. They were difficult; they knew nothing, but theyhad a solution to a giant problem. So as I’ve said before, I would do businesswith the devil, and Cisco was an opportunity because they had a fabuloussolution to a gigantic problem.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And did it continue to be difficult to deal with them?Valentine: No, we got rid of them.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] That’s one solution!Valentine: We replaced them.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, how quickly?Valentine: Not very quickly. The arrangement we made is that we would give them anamount of money: they would have one-third of the company; we would haveone-third of the company; and the future employees would have one-third ofthe company. And the future employees would include new executivemanagement, and we would supply the people to fill those slots. That was theunderstanding. So over time, we got a new president.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I think you would agree that you’re a strong personality?Valentine: After so many years of listening to other people tell me that, I got themessage. I thought at first I knew only all the timid people in the world.[<|endoftext|>
Interviewer chuckles]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Despite the fact that you’ve told me that it’s not just about people, you stillhave to deal with people both within Sequoia and in your dealing with yourlimited partners, et cetera. Where do the social graces come in, if at all? Justplain being able to get along with people and have them do what you wantthem to do? So where is personality in this mix?Valentine: I’m thinking about my sort of customary answer to a question like that. Letme say that I almost never have trouble with smart people. I have a lot oftrouble with dumb people, and that’s a patience issue. So there are things thatI do not engage in, aspects of the business that I don’t engage in, because ofthat patience problem. So if I know there are people that don’t get it, I justavoid counseling with them.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] I can imagine. So it hasn’t been a stumbling block—Valentine: No, it’s any—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I’m thinking of you in a meeting. Don Valentine can’t always knoweverything. So have you been able to bring other people— Well, you musthave been able to bring other people into the picture and reach some kind ofconsensus.Valentine: Yes. Two things are working there. The recognition of the problem is veryeasy. Providing an environment for the other people to participate in makinginvestment decisions is my job. So the first thing that you do is you hirepeople who are very opinionated and very personally confident so they canarticulate their opinion to everybody around the table. They have enoughachievement and skill that the people around the table enjoy what they have tosay and put weight behind it. The second thing is just simply extremelytactical. I never speak first.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is that so?Valentine: I always speak last.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because you want to know what’s out there?Valentine: I want to know what’s out there, and I don’t want them to know what myposition is.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And while you’re listening, does your position tend to change?Valentine: It may very well be moderated by other people’s inputs. But once yourecognize the problem, it’s easy to mechanize around it. But no, I don’t wantto have people in Sequoia who don’t have the confidence to have strongpersonal opinions public, because we need that. I want as far away fromhomogeneity as I can get. I would much rather have people that are vastlydifferent, as different as you can get them. We have people here that are notU.S.-born. A lot of the core people around here are born outside the U.S. Sofrom my point of view, you go to the end of the earth to get strong opinions.Because you see, every time we make an investment, there are fifty-tworeasons to do it and forty-eight reasons not to do it. It’s never seventy-thirty.So you really need people that are willing to pound the table with theirposition, and you need to provide the environment in which they can do that.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is every investment based on the group’s consensus?Valentine: Yes. Some of the people that you’re interviewing use what I refer to as thestar system. The star system is a telephone architecture where all of the handphones go into a central place to be routed somewhere else. I don’t like thatsystem, and we’ve never used that system. What it does is, it prevents peoplefrom emerging, having their own persona and their own confidence. So I don’tlike that system. We don’t use that system.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, you’ve done a thorough job, I think. Are there gaping holes that weshould cover before we wind up?Valentine: I don’t know. I can answer that better if you show me something that I canread. I don’t know how historians operate.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] Casually. You will be getting transcripts to review.Valentine: I’ve got to get rolling. Thank you.
