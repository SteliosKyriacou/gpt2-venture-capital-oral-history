Interviewer: It’s July 21, 2009, and I’m in the office of [J.] Burgess Jamieson at 3000 SandHill Road, which is an iconic address in venture capital. Linda suggested that Isay something briefly about the genesis of this project. We have to credit Pete Bancroft; he had the idea and he agreed to provide thefunding for the first three years. Jamieson: Oh, that’s very generous.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, it is very generous. We have an advisory board of people that youprobably know—Pete Bancroft, Bill Draper, Pitch Johnson, Alan [C.]Mendelson, Jerome Engle, and Charles Faulhaber, who is the director of theBancroft Library, where this project resides. The idea was to start at the beginning, namely with the first generation ofventure capitalists who were actually called that. I’m aware from talking topeople that there were people doing risk investment before that, but it wasn’tcalled venture capital. The board has selected a number of people in that firstgeneration for interviews. So with that, let’s begin. Would you say on-tape what you just said to Lindaand me? Jamieson: Oh, yes, what I said was that I’ve had a terrible time with name memory formy whole career, but my numeric memory is excellent. I said that if peoplehad numbers, I’d have no problems at all! Some CEOs have found out, to theirdismay, that my memory for numbers is very good! [laughter] Better than theywish it were!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, what we’re going to do now is to start at the beginning, namely withyour parents and your upbringing and your education and just roughly movethrough time. In your case, I think it’s interesting that it will take us a while toget to venture capital. Jamieson: Yes. It took me a while to get there, but I’m slow at most things.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I know you were born in Nassau County, New York. Jamieson: Right. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Into what kind of a family? Jamieson: Well, I’ve never had the courage to ask my parents how they felt when I wasborn, because I was conceived before the crash of 1929, and I appeared in1930, and I know their circumstances were very different between those twotimes. But my father’s career evolved into being a builder. He was in thelumber business before the Depression, and I think he lost his job in around1932. He had a number of miscellaneous jobs, which I don’t remember, for anumber of years. My mother had been a secretary, and she worked at AT&T in the patentdepartment. They had a secretarial pool, and one of the patent attorneys wasof German ancestry and had a terrible accent, so the rest of the pool membersdreaded having to take dictation from him. But my mother’s background wasGerman and she understood the language, so she was his favorite. From that,she went on to another, smaller I think, sales division of a larger company andworked there until my parents were married in 1928. She went back to work in 1937 to accumulate enough capital for my father tostart his own business, which he did. His father and my uncle were bothbuilders, and the family history, in that side of the family for years, had beenin the construction and building business. And so he wanted to start his ownbuilding firm, which he did in 1939 as a result of my mother going back towork.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That was quite a contribution. Jamieson: Yes, it was. And she was his bookkeeper for most of the time he was in thebusiness.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was this residential building? Jamieson: Residential—well, it was except during the war when he built commercialbuildings that were part of the war supply situation.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you have brothers and sisters? Jamieson: I have a sister who is a year-and-a-half younger than I am.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So it was hard times for a while, it sounds.  Jamieson: Oh, very hard, very hard, yes. I remember one Christmas I was told I couldhave just one present, and it couldn’t cost more than a dollar. But we alwayshad a tree and decorations.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What kind of a household was it? What was the discipline like? Jamieson: Well, not very comparable to anything today. I have to say it was fairly strict.I don’t have any memories of being unfairly treated. It’s just that our wholelifestyle was much simpler than it is today. For instance, I don’t think we hadenough money to have a telephone until my mother went back to work. Andwe lived with my grandmother.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you have a car? Jamieson: Oh yes, we had a car.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Living with your grandmother was a way to save money, presumably. Jamieson: Actually, her house was on the market. My father built a spec house—that is,a house that was built to sell—and their plan was whichever house sold first,they would sell, and live in whichever one that was left. Of course, that wasmy grandmother’s. So that’s how we wound up there.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You went to public schools? Jamieson: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And right there in Nassau County? Jamieson: Yes. Our grammar school and high school both happened to be in our town,although I had probably about a two-mile walk to high school, but I walked.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You didn’t have your own car. [chuckling] Jamieson: No, I didn’t have my own car.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I figured. Were you getting interested in any particular discipline?  Jamieson: Yes. A very interesting thing happened that shaped my whole life for quite awhile was that when I was nine years old I built a one-tube radio and itworked. And from then on I wanted nothing other than to be an electricalengineer. Never gave a second thought to anything else.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What’s a one-tube radio? Jamieson: Everything in those days was tubes. There were no transistors or integratedcircuits.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I’ve heard other people who ended up in technical careers say so often theradio was what got them interested. Jamieson: Well, my next move in that direction, before I went to college, was I tookelectronics courses in high school. We had them. I got a FCC First ClassRadiotelephone Operator License when I was sixteen, which was aninteresting experience because I had to go to the FCC headquarters in NewYork City with a room full of people taking the examination. Most of thepeople there were in their thirties and forties, and of course I got a lot of notvery pleasant looks. But I passed, and as a result of that I was able to get a jobwhen I was sixteen being a night operator at an FM station, and that was thebest-paying job I had till I got out of college.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And you probably liked it as well. Jamieson: Oh, it was great. I could do my homework. I just had to check the transmitterevery half hour or so, although once in a while I would fill in as atranscription turntable operator, whatever.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You obviously did well in high school, because your biography says you weresecond in a class of about 800. Jamieson: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were you being encouraged in the way of education by your parents? Wasthat something that was expected of you? To do well in school? Jamieson: I think they were pleased when I did do well, and I was certainly encouragedto stay in line, as it were. I had very few adventures as a teenager, other thanvisiting my girlfriends some evenings. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did they have high school educations, your parents? Jamieson: Oh, they both went to college. Oh yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So was college in your future as far as they were concerned? Jamieson: Oh, absolutely.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That was a given. Jamieson: Certainly, and I could get the grades and get admitted. My family had a longtradition of going to Union College in New York, in Schenectady, which hadan affiliation with GE. I got early admission there, and both my father and myuncle went there. My father, I think, was very disappointed that I chose to goto MIT, although he never said much about it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It was hands down MIT as far as you were concerned, because of theengineering? Jamieson: Well, it certainly was a well-recognized school. But another factor was that Ihad a girlfriend who went to Tufts, which is in the Boston area, and that hadsome effect on my choice of school.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] I see. Your bringing up was in Mineola? Jamieson: No, I was just born in Mineola. That was the site of the Nassau CountyHospital. We lived in Floral Park.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is that a small place? I’m just wondering what it was like to all of a sudden bein Cambridge. Jamieson: Oh, it was a small town.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So was Cambridge an adjustment? Jamieson: No, because we were just on the border of New York City, and I could get toManhattan when I was a kid for fifteen cents. Ten cents for the bus and fivecents for the subway. That’s what things were like then, and I would often, very often, go into New York to go around the surplus and second-handelectronics shops and just nose around and see what they had. Once in a whileI’d buy something.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So being in an urban setting was something you were comfortable with. Jamieson: Oh, sure, yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What about MIT proper? How was your adjustment? You have to work just toget into MIT. Jamieson: Well, I never worked very hard in high school at all. I was a National HonorSociety member and we had our club room. We could cut class; we never hadto go to class. All we had to do was pass the quizzes and exams. So we’d sitand play bridge when we felt like it and generally had a very relaxed life. Socompared to that, MIT was like being thrown into a cold lake in the middle ofthe winter.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because you’d had an easy time of it in high school, did you have to learnstudy skills, that sort of thing? Jamieson: I was quite well self-disciplined, I think. At the time I went there, MIT used toadmit a freshman class that was 30 percent larger than the size of thegraduating class they expected. So at the beginning of the second year, 30percent of the class would be gone. I thought they were often intellectuallyvery capable but the main reason they failed was lack of personal disciplineand having good work habits in the absence of their parents.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And you’d probably gotten some of that discipline, as you were implying,from your upbringing. Jamieson: It’s my genes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What to say about what I presume was four years at MIT? Jamieson: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were you changing your ideas in any way about engineering?  Jamieson: [pause] That’s hard to say. I really didn’t change my interests at all. I guess Irefined them to the point of having as an objective, designing great productsthat were also very profitable. So I’ve always had a business interest as wellas a technical interest. My orientation in product design was to keep things assimple as I could because my maxim was: parts that aren’t there can’t fail.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Where did that business side of it come in? Jamieson: I think because my father had his business, and he had to be aware of thefinancial side of it as well as the technical building side. During his career hebuilt somewhere between fifty and sixty houses as a sole proprietorship.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So he was an influence, you think. It wasn’t just the technical sweetness ofengineering, it was the fact that this field could make practical, profit-makingthings. Jamieson: That’s true. But frankly, I always thought my mother had more of a numberssense than he did. Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, her line of work required that, didn’t it? Jamieson: She was probably the strongest influence on my life and my character.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: In terms of the self-discipline you’re thinking? Jamieson: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And how else maybe? Jamieson: In fact, we happen to have a housekeeper who is German, and she likes to kidme by saying I’m more German than some of her friends in Germany![laughter] I was born here, but I spent a lot of time in Germany.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So unpack that a little bit. What characteristics does that encompass that applyto you—when you say you’re Germanic. Jamieson: Being very conscious of duty, being generally punctual as opposed to showingup whenever I feel like it, doing things often that I don’t like to do. I don’t like to fire people, but I have had to do it; in one case about 100 people in onechunk—and that was half the company. Holding other people to high workstandards, giving more than the minimum, or more than was nominallyexpected.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I can see how that’s going to play out in later life. [chuckling] All right. Soyou graduated from MIT in 1952, right? Jamieson: Fifty-two, right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That’s beginning the post-war boom years. Did you feel, as a young graduate,that you were entering a period of time that was very different from what youhad experienced as a very young person in the Depression? Jamieson: Oh yes. I knew it was very different from the Depression. And I rememberpersonally I was just filled with optimism.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were jobs available? Jamieson: Well, I had a scholarship from Grumman Aircraft [EngineeringCorporation]. I had to work there every summer, and the scholarship,informally at least, committed me to accepting an offer from them when Igraduated.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see that you worked there for a year, 1952 to 1953. Jamieson: Yes. It was actually a year and a half.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What did that entail? Jamieson: Oh, I was an electrical engineer working on flight control systems for militaryaircraft.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was that an easy transition? Jamieson: Well, it really wasn’t what I wanted to do. I wanted to be more involved inproduct design. This was more or less quality assuring and testing productsdesigned by others, since I was mostly involved with electronics, andGrumman typically bought those from suppliers. It was fun to fly around in aircraft working on some of these systems, but it wasn’t very educational forme.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You weren’t actually flying though. There was a pilot and you were— Jamieson: No, I was not doing the flying.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And that’s the way airplanes are tested? Jamieson: Well, they were then. We didn’t have computers that did the simulation scalesthat are possible today. But ultimately, yes, every aircraft design has to gothrough a flight test, so to that extent, yes, that’s still done.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was your MIT education serving you well in this job? Jamieson: Oh, it was fine. Sure. I was overqualified, actually. I was bored. Really. I wasactually bored.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] Was that somewhat because there wasn’t a very creative aspect tothis job? Jamieson: That’s right. Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So that probably explains why you didn’t stick with it. Jamieson: Yes, I would say so. Plus the fact that, I think everyone benefits from having amentor, and I really had no mentor there. There was no one with whom Iworked who was really interested in developing my skills.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So you were there just to work, to serve the company. Jamieson: That’s right, yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And you were smart enough to recognize that. Jamieson: [chuckling] Well, one might call it that, but I would say more it was boredomand not intelligence. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: During this period, you are in the U.S Army. Was that in the reserves, then?1952 to 1955, first lieutenant, U.S. Army. Jamieson: Right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: At least that first year and a half or so overlaps— Jamieson: I was at Grumman; I was deferred from being called to active duty because ofa military contractor job. And my solution to getting out of Grumman was tojust not put in my request for deferment, which I had to do every six months.And of course when I didn’t do that I was immediately called to active duty.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That was very clever of you. [chuckling] Well, it’s better than going up toyour boss and saying— Jamieson: “I’m bored here. Goodbye.” [laughter] No, I knew enough, even then, not todo that. I spent two years in the army.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Tell me about that. Jamieson: Well, that was very different. I reported for active duty at Fort Dix to acompany commander who had just gotten back from Korea. In fact, the wholeofficer crew there, pretty much, was a bunch that had been in Korea and justgotten back. So I think it’s fair to say they did not think particularly well ofme [chuckling] since I’d never been in combat. I had no military experienceexcept the equivalent of boot camp and the ROTC. Then, since I was inordnance, I immediately was sent to Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland,and someone took a look at my resume and decided that I belonged in a radarmaintenance unit. So I spent about six months in Aberdeen going to radarschool.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And did you like that? Jamieson: Well, I was the leading student because I already knew all that stuff! Theother interesting thing was everything was on a wartime footing then, so Iwent to school from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m., so I had my whole days free, which waspretty good duty.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So what did you do with your days, then?  Jamieson: I bought a cheap old sailboat, went sailing. Fooled around with my car,whatever. At that time I couldn’t find any decent housing there because it wasa wartime situation. So my wife [Elizabeth] was living with her parents inNew Jersey. I didn’t put my marriage in there.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: No, you didn’t put your marriage in there. What about that? Jamieson: Well, I met my wife when we were both in school in the Boston area. It wasnot the original girlfriend that caused me to go to MIT. She lived in NewJersey. I’ve forgotten about [left out] a lot of things. I got malaria at the end ofmy first term, sophomore year, because I went on a vacation to Florida withmy parents, and we were on an island off the Florida coast. I came back,actually went back to school. I had to walk across the Harvard bridge to get toMIT. I lived in Boston in my fraternity house—and I could barely make itacross the bridge. I just had no strength at all. So I was put in the infirmarythere, and no one knew what was wrong with me. I had 104º fever for twoweeks, and they should have sent me to Mass General, but I just lay there withno medication, no nothing, and fortunately I recovered since I’m still here.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I’m surprised there was still malaria. You hear about it in the nineteenthcentury. Jamieson: It’s kept very quiet that there is such a thing. But that was quite remarkable, inretrospect, that I recovered.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did they diagnose it finally as malaria? Jamieson: When I got home, my parents sent me to a specialist in blood chemistry at ourlocal hospital. They took a number of blood draws, and he came back with theopinion that it looked to him as though I had had malaria. And sure enough itwould come back about every nine months, six to nine months. I’d get terriblechills and get a very high fever, and that kept up for about seven or eightyears. It’s a pretty miserable disease. Jamieson: So anyhow, my [future] wife and I had been dating, but our romance broke upuntil she came to see me. I had to go to summer school to make up mymissing term; I missed the whole second term, sophomore year. She and herfather were on their way to Canada for a vacation, and they stopped in Boston.She came to see me but found out from my fraternity brothers that I was backin the infirmary. So she came there, and that’s really what got our romancestarted again. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: When did you actually marry? Jamieson: 1953.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I was surprised to hear that as late as that it was hard to find housing. Jamieson: Around Aberdeen, Maryland, because there’s a big army base—local housing.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: When was Levittown and all that? Jamieson: Oh, that was on Long Island. That was existing when I was working.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So that was pre-war? Jamieson: No, it got started after the war. It was probably the first planned community. Ithink it started around 1947, something like that. We had half of a two-familyhouse. That’s where we lived.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So when you talk about the fifties being a boom time, it depends where youare. Jamieson: Yes, as I say, I was going to school at night. They were running double shiftsit was so crowded.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: All right. There’s something here on this same CV about [reading from CV]severe arctic climate—radar units— Jamieson: I was supporting radar systems that were providing warning for a SAC[Strategic Air Command] base. I was at Loring Air Force Base, which was infar northern Maine, north of Montreal, Canada, and the winter temperaturesthere went down to minus-45º. We had fifteen feet of snow one winter I wasthere. So we had to supply and support some of the anti-aircraft sites fromhelicopters—the roads were impassable.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But this was all located in Maine. That’s where the units were. Jamieson: That’s right. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I was picturing them up at the North Pole. Jamieson: No, this was the closest point in the United States to Russia and had the mostdays of sun of any location that close to Russia, so that’s why it was chosenfor the air force base.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: This was the beginning of the Cold War when Russia was our enemy. Jamieson: Absolutely. The Cold War hadn’t reached its peak, yet, in fact.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was that very conscious in your mind as a military person? Jamieson: Well, I didn’t think enough about what I was doing, frankly. The maxim isthat old men make war and young men get killed in war. And that’s becauseyoung men don’t realize the risks. It’s going to happen to anyone but them. Ifeel a lot of sympathy for the poor guys in Iraq and Afghanistan.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I know. I can’t help reading those obituaries that are listed in the [New York]Times and look at the ages, and so often they’re in their early twenties.They’re the ones that are getting it. Jamieson: Sure, they are. And the ones that aren’t killed are terribly wounded. There aremore wounded.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That’s going to be the legacy of this war, I think, in terms of human suffering. Jamieson: There may have been, I think, about 4,000 killed, but there have been at least20,000 wounded, and mostly missing arms and legs from IEDs [improvisedexplosive devices].<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did this military experience, now that you can look back on it, have anyformative influence on you either professionally or as a person? Jamieson: Well, I formed and was the commanding officer of a small unit. Andoriginally my commanding officer was in New York City, so he didn’t knowwhat was going on! [chuckling] And we were supposed to go to England as aunit but got changed to Maine in two weeks, so we had no arctic equipment atall. I would write a letter at least once a week to this commanding colonel in New York City, pleading for winter clothing. We had some problems withweather.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, 45º below! Jamieson: Sure. In fact, we couldn’t get boots that were really very good for arctic use.So I actually bought a pair of L.L. Bean hunting boots, which have rubberbottoms and leather tops, and I wore those thinking I’d probably get chewedout by someone for being out of uniform. But the air force didn’t care. I guessthe highest-ranking army officer was a lieutenant colonel. Nobody reallycared. So I wore my L.L. Bean hunting boots for the whole time I was there![laughter] And they were fine with a lot of socks.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: In 1956, you become a project engineer for Doelcam. Jamieson: Doelcam, yes, it was a division of Honeywell.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why did you leave the military, and why Doelcam? Jamieson: Well, I had a two-year tour of active duty. I was offered a regular armycommission but I wisely, in retrospect, turned it down.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Dd you ever think that the military would be a career option? Jamieson: Well, I think the military is a very comfortable place to be once you learn thesystem, which I did. That’s really what got me through MIT. Every year atMIT my grades got higher and higher, and it was because I figured out how toget good grades.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] I was going to say, work the system. Jamieson: Work the system, sure. And in fact I had one mechanical engineering coursewhich I hated; it was strength of materials, and I didn’t go to class for thewhole term. I did turn in all the homework and I took all the quizzes. When Ishowed up for the final, the professor was standing at the door and he said,“Well, Mr. Jamieson, I haven’t seen much of you this term.” [laughter] And Isaid, “No, sir, but I did all the homework and took all the quizzes.” So I tookthe final and I passed. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So, why Doelcam? How did that come to be? Jamieson: I think I used the MIT placement service to get a handle on jobs in the Bostonarea, because my original plan was to go back to school and get a master’sdegree.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh really. Jamieson: Sure. In fact, I went to Northeastern University, evenings, while working, fora while. I couldn’t keep it up. I’d never had a nine-to-five job.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Would it have made a difference to have a master’s degree in engineering? Jamieson: Well, as far as credentials, yes. As far as capability, maybe I’ll flatter myselfby saying, “I don’t think so.” [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: An MBA will get you somewhere in your career today, and I am wondering ifit was something similar in engineering. Jamieson: Probably would have. But I think it makes only a difference in the first one ortwo jobs.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Then they look at performance. Jamieson: Performance and capability. I can tell you a little joke about that.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: All right. Jamieson: In those days there was quite a separation between engineers who worked at adrawing board and those who had desks. Well, I had a desk at Doelcam, but Ireported to a project engineer. I was one of several engineers that did. We gotto the point of having our design done and needing a wiring diagram to build aprototype. And he came to me and asked me if I would work on the drawingboard and do the wiring diagram. I was shocked, because I thought andeveryone else thought, “Poor Jamieson, he’s gotten demoted back to thedrawing board.” Literally. So again, that was a case of my doing somethingthat I really didn’t want to do. But it was discipline. This subsystem that we built—there were 3,000 wires. I finished the wiringdiagram and went down to the lab, and a tech wired up the first system, andthere wasn’t a single mistake. Everything worked. And so my boss then calledme in and said, “Well, now you know why I asked you to do the wiringdiagram. From now on you’re the project engineer.” So I went back to mydesk, and I had the last laugh.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was he testing you? Jamieson: He wasn’t testing me. We had a tight time schedule. He wanted to get to aworking prototype as fast as he could.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But he must have suspected that you could do it. Jamieson: Oh, he did. He said, “Now you know why I asked you to do the wiringdiagram. I knew you would do it and make none or very few mistakes.”<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now at that point was he looking at what you had done? Or is somehow theaura of an MIT engineering degree carrying you at this point? Jamieson: No. He’d been to MIT himself. Almost everyone at the company had gone toMIT! [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So that wasn’t going to get you head and shoulders above anybody else. Jamieson: It didn’t do a thing, no.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It was performance. All right. So what was that job like? Jamieson: Well, it was very good. It was a really nice place to work.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why was that? Jamieson: It was in the Boston suburbs, originally. And it was not a big company, so Ihad more responsibility there than I might have had in a bigger company. Myboss was actually a mentor, too.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Really.  Jamieson: He taught me a lot. We would go out to—there was a local restaurant wherewe could go out every day and we’d have lunch. Not just he and I—the wholecrew. At that time you could get a lunch for 99 cents, so we’d have a 99-centlunch, and he would take the opportunity to expound on his managementtheories and technical ideas, and I just listened. And he was very good.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was this changing any of your ideas about what you might do in addition toengineering? Jamieson: Well, it got me interested in the financial side of business more so than I hadbeen, although I was always very cost-conscious in designing products. Theonly formally organized venture capital organization in the U.S. at that time,as far as I know, was American Research and Development, which was inBoston. And so I read about some of their activities.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because of this mentor? Is that what got you— Jamieson: No, I’m a compulsive reader. Offering me a book is like offering a drink to analcoholic. [chuckling] Sorry, but that’s the way it is. So I just read everythingI could about business, as well as technical literature.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was Georges Doriot influential in any way? Jamieson: No, but I met ARD people at my next job, which was Adage [Inc.], which wasa company started by three MIT graduates, one of whom I’d gone to highschool with and worked with at Grumman. ARD was the principal investor inthat company.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why did you leave Doelcam? Jamieson: Oh because Adage offered me a substantial increase in salary and stockoptions.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And stock options. Jamieson: Yes. As it turned out, they weren’t ever meaningful or profitable. I think I’dbeen making about $9K a year at Doelcam, and Adage offered me $15[K]. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh that’s quite a leap! Jamieson: Which is what I was worth—at least. [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: No ego there! Jamieson: [chuckling] No. But what really irritated me was that when I went to thegeneral manager of our division and told him I was leaving, he immediatelyoffered me the same salary, and that really got me irritated because to me itmeant that they knew all the while that I was worth the $15K and they didn’tgive it to me. So that was that, but it was a great place to work. I liked it a lot.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What was Adage doing? Jamieson: Analog to digital conversion. That was my first experience with transistors,which were just—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: They were just coming in, weren’t they. Jamieson: Yes. The big thing there was that advanced transistors, very fast— We werestill using germanium transistors, which have a very limited temperaturerange. But a company called General Transistor, in Long Island, came outwith a germanium transistor for a dollar, which was a tremendous pricebreakthrough at the time. So we started using germanium transistors and othersemiconductors.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: My memory’s a little blurry on the transistor, but isn’t Bell Labs— Jamieson: It was invented there by Shockley and his— There were three inventors.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And then Shockley goes to California. Jamieson: Shockley left to start— I guess he joined Fairchild. And then I think he left toform Shockley Semiconductor. And people like Gordon Moore and BobNoyce were there. They split to start Intel.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes.  Jamieson: Actually we—Fairchild was one of our vendors. And I can remember makinga business trip out here and meeting Gordon Moore and Bob Noyce.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh really. Jamieson: Oh sure. That would have been in the early sixties.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: These people were publishing in the literature. Were you reading that kind ofthing? The technical journals? Jamieson: Oh yes, sure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were you following the development of transistors, because this is a hotperiod. Jamieson: Oh very much so, yes. That’s why we were using Fairchild as a supplier. Mynext job after Adage, which was my first computer-as-such job. A computercontrol company.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But should we say more about Adage? Jamieson: Well, Adage was a tragedy in terms of its business development. The CEOwas a brilliant tech—this is the story of my life—not my life, but otherpeople’s lives that I’ve had to cope with. Technical people often startcompanies thinking they have the management skills to run bigger and biggercompanies. Well, more often than not, they don’t. Bob Noyce is a sterlingexception to that rule. He was just terrific. Adage was founded by a brillianttechnologist who was personally ill-disciplined and just not a capablemanager. So it eventually foundered after I left.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Would you consider it a startup? Jamieson: It was a startup. I was the fifteenth employee.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So that was really your first taste of a startup company? Jamieson: Yes, well, Grumman was a very large company. 20<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You complained earlier on that your first job wasn’t very creative. Jamieson: That’s right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were you liking the startup environment? Jamieson: [chuckling] Oh it was completely different! It was a lot of pressure. I meanbusiness pressure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You mean to get a product out and selling it so some money was coming in? Jamieson: Right, yes. There were always cash flow problems.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see. And was it venture capital funded? Jamieson: By ARD. They were the only venture capital investor. Other money camefrom doctors and dentists.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: With the advantage of talking to you venture capitalists, I know that venturecapital is more than just investing money. Jamieson: Oh certainly.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It’s building companies. Jamieson: It should be.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, okay, it should be. Jamieson: Now it’s much more investing money. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I want to hear about that, but we’re not there yet. We’re in the fifties;we’re not up in 2009. Jamieson: That’s right. Well, we’re in the late fifties, early sixties. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What I would like to hear you comment on is how carefully ARD waswatching over this company. Jamieson: Well, one of their principals, whose name was Bill Elfers, who later went onto found Greylock [Partners], which was another one of the early venturecapital firms, was on the Adage board. And so I occasionally, not always, butoccasionally, went to board meetings. And so I met him, and I got to know theARD style.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How would you describe the ARD style? Jamieson: Very businesslike, very gentlemanly, very much based on trust. Unfortunatelyin the case of our company president, some of that trust was misplaced.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So would you say they were less likely to step in than maybe you would havedone at a later date? Jamieson: Yes, I think they should have canned the CEO and found a better one.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But was that maybe just the style of ARD at that point? That this tightermanagement of a company that goes along with your style of venture capitalwasn’t as prevalent at ARD? Jamieson: I really don’t know enough about ARD to say, other than that their biggest hitwas Digital Equipment [Corporation]. There the CEO/founder carried thecompany for quite a long while, although he eventually ran out of gas too.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: All right, okay. But you’re learning things all along, aren’t you? Jamieson: Oh sure, sure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I hope I’m not making too much of this track to venture capital. Jamieson: It’s your interview. [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: No, it’s your interview! Jamieson: I’m just here to answer questions. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I don’t think passivity is your nature. [chuckling] Anything more to say aboutAdage? You were there five years. Jamieson: As my wife will tell you, I was there too long. She kept urging me to leavebecause of her opinion of our CEO and his cohorts.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, you must have been talking to her quite a bit then. Jamieson: Oh I did, I did. In fact, the company got very low on cash, and I went withoutsalary one time for about six weeks and was bringing my lunch in a brownbag. My team kept asking me—why are you bringing your lunch in? Whyaren’t we going out for lunch? And of course, I couldn’t say, “Well, I’m notgetting paid.” So I would just say, “Well, I’ve decided to just watch my dietfor a while.” Blah, blah, blah, and got away with it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I can see why your wife might have been paying attention if youweren’t getting paid. Jamieson: Yes. I remember one New Year’s Eve we were there till midnight. Weweren’t out partying—my wife was sitting home. We were there working,trying to ship product before year end. It was something.[End Audio File 1]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Tape number two, and it’s the second hour with Mr. Jamieson. It seems thetime to talk about your three children. Jamieson: Okay.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you want to say quickly what they do? Jamieson: Well, my daughter Ellen is a graduate of Mills College. She’s been in poorhealth for about the last ten years but is gradually getting better. She is justabout at the point of wanting to get back and start part-time work. I’m takingher to Germany in a couple of weeks to be looked at by a homeopathic doctorthat I have a lot of respect for. In fact, she is getting some homeopathic treatment now, which is the first thing that she’s gotten that has really helpedher.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And is it because of her that you got interested in homeopathy? Jamieson: No, I go to Europe four or five times a year. I like Switzerland very much.We’ve been going there for thirty years. I love the mountains and I love tohike. And I have a very good friend who lives in the German alps who told meabout this doctor and some of the results of his treatment. He gives courses aswell as practices, and my friend has been to a number of his courses he thinksso well of him.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I hope it cures her. And then the two other children? Jamieson: My eldest son officially is John Burgess III, but he’s called Sandy. He wasvery blond when he was young. He is in the precious stones and jewelrybusiness.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How did that come about—briefly. Jamieson: Who knows. I don’t know. And my youngest son was at Lawrence LivermoreLaboratory but just got laid off due to budget problems.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So Adage and then Memory Systems Division? Jamieson: At Computer Control Company [1963-1968]. That’s right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So how did you become employed there? Jamieson: Well, I stayed with Adage until they got through the bad times and theirbusiness turned, and I felt things were going well enough so that I could getout of the place, honestly. [chuckling] So I started looking for otheropportunities. It was kind of interesting. When I told the CEO that I wasleaving he said, “Well, how can you leave when things are looking so good?”And my answer was, “How could I leave when they were bad.” So—interesting difference of views. So I left.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And then why did you move to Computer Control Company?  Jamieson: It was a combination of analog and digital design, which is what I had hadexperience with at Adage. So there was a fit. But there was need for a newlevel of engineering management there because the company had grown quitewell. We were living in Wellesley. The company was in Framingham, so itwas an easy commute. And it was also a pleasant place to work.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It seems like a lot of job changes since graduation. Let’s see, one, two, three,four. Jamieson: Well, I do have a problem.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What’s your problem? Jamieson: I’m not very good at working for other people, [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I might have guessed! But you’re slowly working up the hierarchy, aren’tyou? Jamieson: Oh sure. I had more and more people to manage, sure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But you still were having to report to somebody at Computer ControlCompany? Jamieson: I reported to the chief engineer, and he and I got along fine. We used to havereviews on a regular basis. I’m sure I left Adage making more than I did whenI started, but there was no organization there to have anything that wasregular. Anyhow, we had regular reviews [at Computer Control], and at one ofmy last ones he told me that I caused more trouble than anyone else whoreported to him. And I said, “Well, why do you put up with it?” And he said,“Well, it’s because you get so much done.” And I said, “Well, maybe that’swhy I cause so much trouble!” [laughter] But we were good friends, and westill are.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But he wasn’t a mentor in the way that the man at Doelcam was. Jamieson: No. My manager at Doelcam was the best mentor I had in my whole career.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Anything more to say about Computer Control Company?  Jamieson: Well, then I became chief development engineer.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: This was 1963 to 1968. Why don’t you say something about the status of thecomputer industry at this time. Jamieson: I think the Digital Equipment PDP-16 was probably the first trueminicomputer. And at that time we had, typically, 24-bit word lengths whichled to more capability, but Digital had the right, really the right product. Soour follow-on to our 24-bit machine was the DDP-16, which was a verysuccessful product.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see, and was Computer Control Company thinking of personal use at thispoint? Jamieson: No. Our fully populated computer, of the kind that we built, could easily takeup a room the size of this office.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Really! Jamieson: It would be less powerful than what’s sitting on my desk. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: These computers would be for industry use? Jamieson: More military at that time. The space program, pretty much, was a big user ofminicomputers.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And is that pretty true of all these companies? That the military contracts werea big part of their business? Jamieson: Military and research applications were where the minicomputers were firstused. Business use, very large computers, which Honeywell made, and IBM,of course, was the lead producer in that market.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you have any opinion about how it is to work under government contract? Jamieson: I was pretty well detached from all the contract stuff. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I’m leaping ahead to all the screw-ups we read about in military contracting,in the wars nowadays. Was the system better in those days? Jamieson: Well, we were not doing any government-sponsored research or development.We were selling products based on commercial systems. But we had asystems engineering department that would configure and add peripherals formilitary applications. I had nothing to do with that. I was on the productdevelopment side of the business. But wars are won by those who make theleast mistakes, not by those who do everything right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is that a Jamieson adage? Jamieson: Yes, I’m full of adages. [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Then you go to Los Angeles to work for Electronic Memories and Magnetics. Jamieson: Right. That was a monumental move.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why did you do it, and what did you find? Jamieson: It was a chance to get into general management much faster. Oh, by that timeComputer Control Company had been acquired by Honeywell, so I was backwith Honeywell again. It was a good company, but they had their practices asto advancement into general management. I thought it would take me anotherfive years to get into some general management role at Honeywell, and Icould immediately do that at Electronic Memories.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Your life, as you’d led it so far, had been very East Coast-oriented. Jamieson: Right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What was it like to go to this place called Los Angeles? Jamieson: Well, I’d been there many times on business, and I always thought it was thelast place in the world that we’d want to live. [chuckling] So, in fact, wethought about the offer for five months before I decided to take it. The way Isold it to my wife was, “Well, we’ll go out for a year and try it out, and if it doesn’t work out, we’ll just move back again, and I’ll get another job backhere.”<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And here you are, not quite in Southern California. Jamieson: Still stuck here. Just stuck in the mud. [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So did your wife end up liking it? Jamieson: She liked the Los Angeles climate, and we lived in a suburb that was veryeastern, so it was much more comfortable than what one usually thinks ofwhen Los Angeles is mentioned.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And how did the general manager job turn out? Did it live up to yourexpectations? Jamieson: I was in over my head, really, which is when I’ve learned the most in mycareer. I felt significant pressure to pick up all the financial stuff that I neverhad anything to do with at Computer Control, and manage a plant in HongKong as well as our local plant—that was an eye-opener.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were you learning by doing? Jamieson: Sure, yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [reading] You started a new subsidiary in Singapore. Jamieson: I’ve said many times that I’ve always learned the most in my career when I’vebeen in a little over my head.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because that’s where the challenge lies, right? Jamieson: Sure, right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And you don’t panic, I don’t imagine. Jamieson: No. [chuckling] <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I surmised that you didn’t. Jamieson: I made a lot of mistakes, but no great big ones.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You were there three years, and then in that period, you were chief operatingofficer at Sycor, [Inc.], in Michigan. Jamieson: Right. That was the low point of our marriage, because I was only home everyother weekend. I couldn’t take the jet lag of flying home every weekend. Itwas a three-hour time difference.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So you had a flat in Michigan. Jamieson: I had an apartment that I rented. Well, for six months I lived in the localHilton, and I could see that that was just too much transience for me, so I gotan apartment.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And why were you willing to make such sacrifices for this company? What isSycor? Jamieson: It was a company that had the first microprogrammed computer terminal. Thetechnology was outstanding; the management was very weak. So mycompany, Electronic Memories, invested in Sycor. Sycor was a publiccompany, and I think the public stock at that time was trading for around $12.We bought a convertible preferred at about $4 a share, and that was generalknowledge in the company. And I remember I had to have a company meetingshortly after I got there to introduce myself and answer questions. One of thequestions was, “Well, if Sycor stock is trading for $12, how were you able toinvest at $4?” I never expected that one. So I had to think fast, and my answerwas, “Well, it’s the difference between the retail and the wholesale price.”And amazingly, no one asked what I meant by that—that was the end of thequestions about the stock price.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And you sighed a sigh of relief! Jamieson: I thought it was outrageous myself. It was an outrageous answer!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: All right, so that position went on for only about a year.  Jamieson: That was a tremendous learning experience.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Please tell me about that. Jamieson: Well, the reason we were able to invest was that the company was running outof cash, so they needed money, and we were able to negotiate a very favorableprice. After I got there, I cut the employment way back, got the cash burn rateway down. They had product quality problems. Our major customer wasOlivetti, originally an Italian typewriter company. I went to Italy andrenegotiated the contract that we had. The place was running like a hobby—at5:00 the engineering lab would be dead; everyone would be gone. [chuckling]So I knew the style had to change drastically, and I did it by setting anexample. I was there. And after about six months, people started stickingaround until later, and we solved the quality problems and things startedclicking, things got a lot better.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Electronic Memories and Magnetics bought Sycor? Jamieson: Electronic Memories invested in Sycor; they didn’t buy it. It was still a publiccompany. Then when things got running better, I was able to go out and raiseventure capital from venture capitalists to fund the growth and the operations.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So that was your first taste of venture capital? Jamieson: No, I didn’t mention that at Electronic Memories the officers had a littleprivate venture pool going, and I participated in that. I was able to because wehad always saved money compared to the modern style. [chuckling] So Iactually had some capital to invest in startups.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And you must have done all right. Jamieson: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Or you would not have continued. Jamieson: Well, I didn’t understand how difficult a business venture capital was. That’swhy I got in it! I thought it was easy, looking in from the outside. 30<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: At that point were you thinking further than, this is an investment that mightmake me money? Were you realizing that there was probably more to it? Jamieson: No, my focus was on backing startup companies and turning them into bigger,profitable companies. I never thought about it as a way of making a lot ofpersonal money. Although I think I realized at Sycor that I’d never been, up tothen, in a situation where I had any significant equity play in any of thecompanies where I worked. I had Honeywell stock options. They were nice,but they didn’t amount to a fortune.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But you just said that it was personal investment at Electronic Memories. Jamieson: Yes, they turned out well.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You were hoping to make some personal money? Jamieson: Oh that turned out very well, yes. What didn’t turn out well was my being inMichigan. So that’s what led to my leaving Electronic Memories and Sycor.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But you wouldn’t have had to leave Electronic Memories, would you? Jamieson: Well, I couldn’t go back to my previous general management job, so withoutthat there really wasn’t any particular reason to stay.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Your responsibilities now were totally with Sycor. Jamieson: Oh yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It wasn’t just that you were overseeing Sycor. Jamieson: No, I had nothing to do with EMM’s business at that point.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see. In 1971, you become special limited partner—and I don’t know whatthe special means—in WestVen Management. Jamieson: It should be WestVen, incidentally. That’s a typo [in my CV]. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was this a venture capital partnership? Jamieson: Yes, of which the Bank of America was the general partner. That’s why I wasnot a general partner, although the actual management were limited partners.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now is it quite common, by this time, for corporations to have a venturecapital wing? Jamieson: Oh the way to get in the business at that time was to join a bank-affiliatedventure fund, which is what WestVen was. The Bank of America also had itsown SBIC, which was separate from WestVen.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, when did the non-SBIC—divisions would you call them?—begin toarise in American business? Jamieson: I’d say in the sixties, the late sixties.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was it what we would think today of venture capital—it just happened to bewithin a larger company? They were doing the same kinds of things? Jamieson: The bank-affiliated funds were doing just what we’re doing—the same kind ofventure capital, yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And that’s what Reid Dennis was doing for Fireman’s Fund? Jamieson: It was with American Express, yes. He was with Fireman’s; it was acquiredby American Express.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I remember that Bob Swanson, who becomes co-founder of Genentech, firstcame out for the venture capital aspect of Citicorp. Citibank, maybe it wascalled at that point. Jamieson: Yes, I think so.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So it is a thing that’s happening. Jamieson: It was the way you get into the business. Of course, private or independentventure funds are much more interesting than the bank ones. Because in the case of the bank ones, I think they took a significant part of the carry,probably paid people’s salaries and bonuses. I don’t really know. I had alimited partnership interest at WestVen. I don’t even remember now howmuch it was, but it was not in any way equal to the ownership of a privateventure firm.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But is this a full-time job? Jamieson: Sure. Oh yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So give me a flavor of what was happening. Jamieson: Well, I was at Sycor and commuting to Los Angeles. And I was introduced toPhilip Greer, who had been with A.G. Becker, which was a significantsecurities firm in New York. He left to form Weiss, Peck, and Greer, whichwas a small sort of boutique Wall Street investment banking firm. Through aco-investment with Bank of America, he had been on a board with one of thevice-presidents of Bank of America, and he talked that person into sponsoringthe start of this venture fund, WestVen. And I was introduced to Philip Greerthrough a mutual friend.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why would Philip Greer be interested in having you as a partner? Jamieson: I had some operating skills, which he didn’t. He was a financial person.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So were you to be the one who actually looked over these companies in termsof their management? Jamieson: Oh there were a number of limited partners or staff members. Phil was veryactive in looking at companies from a financial point of view.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I interpreted what you said was that you were more to look at how theyoperated. Is that not right? Jamieson: Yes, I think that’s true.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Philip Greer was looking back at your considerable experience in actuallyrunning businesses.  Jamieson: I don’t really know. I think the idea might have been that if companies neededto have operating help, I could do something about it, or I could evaluate whattheir operating skills were. I remember him telling me that some of hispartners in New York, or maybe it was acquaintances, asked, “Well, why areyou bringing an operating person into a venture capital business?” [chuckling]So that was the New York view of venture capital, that it was just another sortof investment and that a venture capitalist would not take an active role inmanaging any business. Whereas my view was that the venture capitalbusiness was really more the development of new businesses than a financialactivity and that if the business development were successful, the financialsuccess would follow.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was that something that you had gotten from your observation of ARD? Jamieson: I think that influenced it to some extent. However, I had not seen ARDinvolve itself as directly in management as I later involved myself.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, you spoke about the company that floundered for a long time withoutARD stepping in. Jamieson: I think they were too tolerant of the CEO.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But also, you’d had gradually more and more management experience, hadn’tyou, in these various jobs that you’d had? I mean, you’d been a pretty handson-the-company type for a number of years now. Jamieson: Sure. That’s right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You were coming at it from a different perspective, I would think, than theinvestor wanting to make a bit more money but not interested in the companyper se. It was just the investment. Jamieson: That’s right. In fact, I’m educationally unqualified for what I’ve been doingfor thirty years or thirty-five years. [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh everybody notes that too! It’s just a miracle how you happened to staggeralong. Jamieson: I’m very good at fooling people! [laughter] <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is it too cliché to use this difference in ways of looking at risk investment asan East Coast/West Coast division? Jamieson: [pause to think] That’s a good question. No, I wouldn’t [look at it that way.]For instance, Arthur Rock, who at the time I think was in New York, was theprincipal backer of Intel. And he certainly, I think, had in mind building asubstantial business.Well, it’s hard to imagine Bob Noyce not beingsuccessful, in retrospect! [laughing] Maybe it was much less clear then. Youshould interview Arthur Rock. Jamieson: Bob Noyce, unfortunately is dead. His favorite weakness was he was a chainsmoker and never stopped. I admired him very much. He was an MITgraduate too.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Maybe we’re jumping ahead, but the East/West thing interests Pete Bancroftand me: what there is about this region that has been so welcoming of venturecapital and high technology in general. Jamieson: Certainly the New York-based venture investors never invested with the ideaof having any direct involvement in the businesses. I mean, the Rockefellers; Ican’t think of the other [firm name], the second name is Trask—I forget itsfirst name. He was very prominent, Spencer Trask; it was an early venturefirm. Never thought, I think, of building businesses in the sense of havingpersonal involvement in them. They thought of providing a tool with theirmoney, I think, which was another way to view the business. We’ll get ahead of the story, but after Institutional Venture Associates reallyfell apart, loosely speaking, I was approached by Schroders, a London firm, tostart a venture fund for them. We had a discussion of business styles, andtheirs was that they wanted someone to do lots of deals on the basis that a fewof them would work out very well. Now that’s the financial approach: be welldiversified and something will work, even though many don’t. I said, “Well,I’m sorry, that’s not the way I want to engage in the business. I feel that thebusiness should be one of building companies, and if the company-building issuccessful, then the money will follow.” So we had a pleasant discussion but afirm parting of the ways.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, please get back to what this region itself might provide for people likeyou. You did end up in California, and you could have returned to the EastCoast. There must have been something here that kept you.  Jamieson: Well, I’ll give you a couple of reasons. One was that it was too easy to stay.We had a nice house in Wellesley, and the kids were happy. It was a verypleasant place to live. The other one was that I didn’t want to get to be[chuckling] retirement age—I’m laughing because I’m well past the usualretirement age now—and be wondering what would have happened if we’dmoved to the West Coast. [chuckling] That’s why I said, “Well, we’ll go outfor a year and try it out.”<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Forty years later. Jamieson: Yes, forty years later. There are things that would have been better in the wayof just general lifestyle for us in the East. I’m much more of an easterner thana West Coast person. But all in all, there’s been more business opportunityhere than there would have been there.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And is that in the end what kept you here? Jamieson: [pause to think] Well, I think what kept me here was that I was always busy.[chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: No time to move! Jamieson: No time to think about drastic changes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You know Californians like to think of this particular region, Silicon Valley,as being a risk-tolerant area. Do you find that’s a credible way of looking atit? That people here are willing to start businesses that have a good chance offailing, and if they fail they just—they start another business. Or is that a myththat people here like to propagate? Jamieson: Well, I think that Stanford University had a lot to do with creating theenvironment that led to the start-up business in venture capital opportunity,something which MIT I think missed the boat on.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh do you? Jamieson: Sure. Early on. The only significant, the only company that was an MITspinoff that really got big was Digital Equipment, and that, of course, is gone.It ended up in failure. There are no Intels in the Boston area or on the EastCoast generally. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I interviewed, some time ago, Niels Reimers, who was head of the Office ofTechnology Licensing at Stanford. I thought it was indicative that at one pointin his career he went from Stanford to MIT to get their licensing office up tospeed. Historically you would think it would go the other way—that MIT hadbeen in the technology field longer than Stanford had, and it should have allthe appurtenances for technology transfer and all of that. Jamieson: It never had the leadership. I give most of the Stanford credit to Professor[Frederick] Terman. He was just an outstanding personality. There was noequivalent MIT personality.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: In the end it does take, in many cases, an individual who has that particulardrive. Niels Reimers saw that wonderful work was coming out of Stanford,and some of it was patented, but nobody was working hard on making activelicenses. Jamieson: Well, Reid Dennis had a partner after I left that was from the Stanfordlicensing activity—John Poitras.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, I know that name. Jamieson: He was not a long-term player in the venture business, and I don’t know muchabout why not. Reid could make some comment.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I didn’t know to ask him. Well, I kind of diverted us. Well, what is there to say about WestVen as, Iguess we would say, your formal introduction to venture capital? Is that fair? Jamieson: Yes, in those days the way to get into the business was by joining a bankaffiliated venture fund. And I knew, at the time I made the decision to do that,that Phil Greer and I were not likely to be together long.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] Would you care to go into that? Jamieson: Let me make a general comment, which is that I think people from Wall Streetor New York, have much more of a transaction mentality than an investormentality. Phil’s emphasis was on doing deals. He was like Schroders, Ithink—the more deals done, the better he would like it. And I was much more interested in the operating side of businesses and in trying to be selective inchoosing businesses which had a good long-term chance of success. So it’snot a matter of right and wrong; it’s just a matter of different approaches tothe business. So I thought, eventually, our differences would accentuate ratherthan minimize, and in fact they did.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I’ve talked to Bill Draper, as I mentioned, and he claims that Draper, Gaither,& Anderson was the first venture capital firm. I suppose he’s meaning freestanding—not associated with a larger company. But would you even go thatfar? Jamieson: Well, I believe ARD was; I think they started in 1957. Draper, Gaither &Anderson were in business before then?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: No. Jamieson: [Georges] Doriot had taught at Harvard Business School.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That’s right. Maybe Bill said on the West Coast. Jamieson: As far as I know that was certainly so.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were you aware of the free-standing limited partnerships that were beginningto spring up? Jamieson: Sure, sure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because by ’72, there’s also Kleiner & Perkins. Jamieson: That’s right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And maybe others. Jamieson: In fact when IVA started, we and Kleiner Perkins were the only venture firmsat 3000 Sand Hill [Road, Menlo Park].<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I looked for Kleiner Perkins on the directory there, and I didn’t see themlisted.  Jamieson: Oh they’re not here anymore. They have their own building down the road.They’re much too big for 3000 Sand Hill.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Should we get into Institutional Venture Partners? Jamieson: It was IVA [Institutional Venture Associates] originally.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were you part of IVA? Jamieson: Sure. I was a founder, along with Burt McMurtry and Reid Dennis and oneother partner. IVP is the current name, but when I was there, I believe it wasInstitutional Venture Associates, so that could be changed.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Reid Dennis made a distinction between the two. Jamieson: Yes, IVP is what he carried on with after IVA disbanded.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was IVA founded in 1973? Jamieson: Yes. Well, it actually raised its capital in ’74, but it started in ’73. I was therefrom September of ’73 on.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you want to talk about how the three of you, right, are the generalpartners? Reid Dennis, Burt McMurtry, and— Jamieson: Well, there were four. The fourth one left the partnership.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh, who was that? Jamieson: Jim Norris. He worked for Reid at American Express.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, I remember the name now. Do you want to say how you met and howyou decided to form this enterprise? Jamieson: One of the companies that the officer group of Electronic Memories investedin was Storage Technology, in Boulder, Colorado. Reid looked at the samestartup, I guess for American Express. He was on the board of Storage Tech. And we had a venture capitalist association, Western Association of VentureCapitalists, which at that time met for lunch about once a month in SanFrancisco, and I got to know Reid by being active in that organization.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And Burt McMurtry? Jamieson: He was in the venture business with a person named Jack Melchor.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh yes. Jamieson: I don’t recall the name of their partnership, but I think he and Jack haddifferences in style. Their principal investor was an Arabian—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That’s right. The name begins with K. Jamieson: Khashoggi. Adnan Khashoggi.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, exactly. Jamieson: I do remember some names! [chuckling] 0f course that business, as a privateventure fund, preceded IVA. It was really a family fund for this Khashoggifamily; it was not an organized entity.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So what was the genesis of the IVA partnership? Jamieson: Reid had been a personal venture investor since the early fifties in Ampex, forinstance. I think he did Measurex.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, he did, and he did well. Jamieson: Did very well, so he wanted to get in the venture business. He was in themutual funds business with American Express, so they decided to split, and hegot American Express to back him contingent on his finding suitable partners[chuckling] who turned out to be Norris—well, Norris was there [at AmericanExpress]—who turned out to be Burt McMurtry and me. So that’s how we allgot together. And then we spent about nine months trying to raise money in the midst ofthe ’73 oil crisis and the market decline. It was just like today, or the past few 40months. And I remember we visited—I think it was Travelers Insurance andhad a very good meeting with Eli Shapiro, who was their chairman and alsoon the Harvard Business School faculty, and their V.P. of investments. Wethought we’d had a great meeting, so we all came back here and waited aboutthree weeks and heard nothing. So since Reid was the senior partner, we elected him to make a call and seewhat was going on, why we hadn’t heard. So he called this VP of investmentat Travelers and said that from our view we thought we’d had a very goodmeeting and were looking forward to having them as limited partners, andwhat was their thinking? And there was a few seconds of silence on the otherend of the phone and then this VP said, “What’s the matter with you guys onthe West Coast? Don’t you know the sky is falling?” So that was the end of Travelers. And then we had another insurancecompany, I think it was, who had committed and which backed out a coupleof months before our planned closing, and that put us below our minimumcapital, which I think was $15 million. So we had to start over again, and wehad to tell all of the committed partners that we were below our minimum andso we could not close as planned. Wonderful.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, just a great way to start a partnership. Jamieson: What a friend, what a friend! [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What was this doing to you psychologically? Jamieson: Oh it was tough.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you ever think, I’ll just go back and get a job? Jamieson: I never thought about it, no. I thought something would happen, and as I say,in those days, starting in the fifties, I was full of optimism. I didn’t knowenough to be critical.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What about your wife? Your wife had stepped in before when you weren’tgetting paid and said something. Jamieson: That’s right. Oh well, I stayed at Adage much past the not-getting-paid period. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: She must have been getting a little concerned about this new partnership goingnowhere or maybe going down. Jamieson: I imagine she was.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But she was not saying so? Jamieson: Maybe I didn’t want to have an answer, so I didn’t ask her. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, shall we stop there? I have some questions off-tape to get me orientedfor the next interview. Is that all right with you as a pause? Jamieson: That’s fine.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Today is July 28, 2009, and this is the second interview with Mr. Jamieson. Iwant to start with a comment that you made last time. You said something tothe effect that IVA, which is Institutional Venture Associates, fell apart. Jamieson: Yes, right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why? Give me some background. Jamieson: Well, I was not really directly involved, but there was a conflict between mytwo other partners. One felt, in view of what he had contributed to thepartnership in the way of successes, he was unfairly compensated in terms ofhis ownership, whatever, and that he should have a larger ownership share inany successor partnership. I had no opinion on the matter; I was not involvedin the discussion at all. So I found out about it after the fact. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see. Jamieson: Well, it was quite a surprise to me, and not a happy one. But like many otherevents in my life, things that at the time seemed to be great misfortunes turnout very much for the better, so it was one of those. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Meaning that then you had to find something else? Jamieson: Well, no. Frankly, I was fed up with partners after hearing what happened,and for four years I just went back to investing my own capital, which workedout fine because that really laid the foundation for Sigma I.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It wasn’t yet Jamieson and Company? Jamieson: I had started Jamieson and Company before Sigma [Partners], because my twopartners—each had gone off and started a new institutional partnership. I wasinvolved in neither of those, so I wanted to continue investing, and the vehiclewas Jamieson and Company.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So your two former partners somehow found a modus operandi. IVA becameInstitutional Venture Partners at that point, didn’t it? Jamieson: Yes, and Burt McMurtry started a new partnership at the same time,Technology Venture Investors. TVI.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, TVI. So they worked it out somehow. Jamieson: Well, they worked it out to separate. They didn’t want to be in business witheach other.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: According to your chronology, you were at IVA/IVP from 1973 to 1994—isthat indeed right? Jamieson: Oh well that was the legal dissolution of the partnership. This controversy, orthis disagreement, took place in 1980, and the legal entity continued becausethe partnership still had investments which had to be liquidated.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see, but you were not active in it at that point? Jamieson: Reid Dennis had the longest-lasting investment that required that thepartnership continue in business.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see, but it wasn’t starting any new deals.  Jamieson: It wasn’t doing any—it was just liquidating slowly [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see, I see. Okay. You can see how it’s a little confusing to me, though. Jamieson: I understand, yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And then Sigma Partners [1984-1993] came along, and I know that yourpartner was named Brad [C. Bradford] Jeffries. How did you become partners,and what was his background? Jamieson: Well, he was actually the attorney for the formation of Sigma. After themoney was raised, there was some question as to what would happen if Ibecame disabled or incapacitated. The solution was that he was given a minorpartnership interest in exchange for becoming a partner.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But Sigma was really Burgess Jamieson. Jamieson: Yes, I raised the money, right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And how did you raise the money? What were you hoping to invest in? Jamieson: Well, those are two different questions.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, please start with one. Jamieson: How I raised the money was I took the easy route, although I had it backwardswhat would happen. I thought it would be very hard to raise the money andvery easy to assemble a group of partners—and the reverse was true. It wasmuch easier to raise the money than I thought and much harder to staff thepartnership. I never had any intention of running it as a one-man generalpartnership. The way I raised the money was to pick off the low-hanging fruitby going around to the partners of IVA and asking them for money. Myrecollection is that about half the capital came from former IVA partners. Soonce that much was raised, it was easier to attract other money, although thelast capital came from Sanwa Bank in Japan, to which I was a consultant forabout ten years starting in 1980.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Going back to IVA partners wasn’t considered fishing in the same pond?  Jamieson: Well, Reid and Burt had already done the same thing, so they had hardly anyreason to complain, and they didn’t complain. Although I’m told that Reidsaid, when he was about to start his second partnership, that I’d taken all themoney. But that wasn’t true. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: He somehow found some more somewhere. Jamieson: Sure, of course. He’s very good at raising money.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: All right. Then the second question—what did you do with it? Jamieson: All right. I thought that a decision to invest in Sigma Partners would beexceptionally easy, because for four years I’d been doing startups, and I couldsimply cherry-pick, as it were, my own portfolio, get in some very goodcompanies in later rounds, and therefore have lower risk than a typical venturecapital partnership. And in fact that was true, because we only lost 5 percentof our capital. [chuckling] One of the partners, I think it was Rod Adams ofStanford, complained and said, ‘Well, Burge, that means you weren’t takingenough risk.” [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So you can’t win, can you! Jamieson: You can’t please everyone. You can’t please everyone.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I gather that 5 percent is a very low number. Jamieson: Oh absolutely.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What is more average? Jamieson: I don’t really know, but I would say there are some partnerships that lose alltheir capital! Not many, but there have been some real bloopers along theway. More in the later years than recent, although I’m aware of one group,one partnership, that started about the time of Sigma with a faulty conceptwhich did lose all of its capital. In fact, it raised some debt and not only lostits original capital but all the debt as well. Needless to say, those people arenot in business now. [chuckling] <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I bet they’re not. When investors have that kind of experience, is it yourexperience that they’re very leery about further investment? Or do they justsay, “Well, that was a bad deal; I’m going to go on to better ones.” Jamieson: Well, the statistics show that there’s a great adherence to investing in venturecapital/private partnerships in spite of greatly reduced rates of return in thiscentury. I think the returns in the venture capital business, in general, peakedin 2000 or 2001, and they’ve never been the same since.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But is that pattern because the returns may be lower, but they’re still betterthan other forms of investment? Why do people continue to invest in venturecapital? Jamieson: Well, to begin with, there are other kinds of investment that yield better ratesof return in recent years. As to why institutions continue investing, you’ll haveto ask them. Other than an indirect interest in Sigma partnerships that haveformed since then, I’ve only made one venture capital investment since I leftSigma, and that’s [in] a German firm that’s oriented towards startups.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You said, the returns peaked in 2000-2001. Jamieson: Yes, the rates of return were very good in the late twentieth century. I wastalking about the twenty-first century [when the returns went down].<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, that’s understandable with the economic downturn. Jamieson: From what I see, the typical, the average of many funds in terms of return oncash is one-and-a-half times, compared to many times that. The last Sigmapartnership, of which I was the managing partner, returned eight times itscash. That was an ’89 partnership.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, since the subject has come up, namely the economic downturn, do youhave observations to make? Jamieson: Well, personally I feel that the fiscal and monetary policies of our governmentare incorrect and will lead at some point in future time to significant rates ofinflation as were experienced in the seventies. There’s no justification orvalidation yet for the huge bailout funds that have been established, and eventhe president of Czechoslovakia, when he saw what the U.S. was doing,declared it as “the road to hell.” <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I read that. Jamieson: I’m inclined to agree with him.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you believe, however, that financial institutions need some restructuring? Jamieson: Well, certainly the educational institution endowment funds have tosignificantly change their policies, because they’re very heavily orientedtoward private partnerships, which involve lockups of many years andcontinued capital calls over some time period. In fact, some funds apparentlydon’t have the liquidity to make the capital calls that they’re subject to, sothey have a big problem.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: If you were directing one of these funds, what would you be investing in? Jamieson: Well, I would be more inclined to invest in assets that are more inflationproof. I would say, in general, that precious metals are a significantopportunity and very liquid. Both the metals themselves and the companiesthat mine them have assets in the ground, and you can extend that to oil,uranium, even base metals, which largely track rates of inflation in theirmarket prices.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you see institutions moving in those directions? Jamieson: Just starting. Well, some have recognized that danger earlier, but there still isno large general trend toward that. I sit on a couple of investment committees,and in one case we have a well-known advisory firm counseling us, and—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Investment committees at educational institutions? Jamieson: No, these are cultural ones. I recommended an investment in an asset that Ifelt was more inflation proof than many others that we have. Afterconsiderable discussion over quite a few months we agreed to invest in thatasset, and I turned to our advisor/representative and asked him if among hisclients if any of them had investments in this particular asset and he said,“No.” And my answer was, “Good!” [laughter] <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, what about your own business? What about Jamieson and Company?How has it been affected, and what are you maybe doing differently than youwere doing in good times, aside from investing more broadly? Jamieson: Well, what do you define as good times? Is that 1999 or 2007?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, all right, better times. Pre-the downturn, which I guess you date back tolate 2008, right? Jamieson: Well, it actually started in spring of 2007, I would say. But other people havedifferent opinions. Well, I have liquidated a lot of equities. For years, becauseof my age, I have more fixed income investments than I ever dreamed that Iwould have when I was in the venture capital business, and that’s been good.I’ve been diversified into foreign currencies since 2002; that’s worked outvery well because of the weakness of the dollar. I have added to my positions,or my position, in inflation-resistant assets, and so far that’s worked out well.But on the other hand, I have to say, I lost money in 2008, but not nearly asmuch as heavily equity-oriented investors or the very large universityendowments. So on a relative basis, my portfolio performed well in the first—I don’t have a Q2 balance sheet yet, but in the first quarter of this year I wasflat, basically, no change.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Which is good in this situation. Jamieson: Yes, in this environment, I would say it’s good, yes. But it’s a very difficulttime, and it takes a lot of time for gathering information and thinking aboutwhat it all means.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do I gather from what you’re saying that Jamieson and Company is notstrictly a venture capital institution? Jamieson: It has almost nothing to do with venture capital.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see. Jamieson: Now. Originally, it did. It was a vehicle for mainly investing in startups,which I did from 1980 to ’84.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And this is with all your own money, right?  Jamieson: Oh yes, it was all my own money, right. As I say, it was cherry-picking thatportfolio that made me think that an investment in Sigma I was a very easydecision. And I told you what our total loss was. On the other hand, returnswere not as high as some funds; I think our return was somewhere in the 20percent annualized range, which is okay, but not startling.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were you happy with that? Jamieson: I was happy to be able to raise the money and get a business going.[chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Getting back to starting Sigma, you said there was a difficulty in findingpartners— Jamieson: General partners, not limited partners.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh, I see. Jamieson: No, it was relatively easy to raise the money. As I say, half of it came fromIVA investors, and the original goal was to raise $20-$25 million. I didn’twant a big partnership, and we ended up raising $44 million and just had tocut it off at that point.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did it work well just to have one other general partner who, from the way I’minterpreting what you said, was really there for a legal reason, not for aninvestor reason. So it was essentially you that was head of this partnership,right? Jamieson: Yes, for a while. But I was actively looking for additional partners andassociates.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why did you have trouble? Jamieson: Well, it was probably me. I’m too demanding. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: In what sort of way? How are you demanding?  Jamieson: I have high-performance standards which I fail to meet myself from time totime.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But everybody else has to meet them. Jamieson: No, I don’t expect—there’s a difference between expectation—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That was a facetious remark. I apologize. [chuckling] Jamieson: That’s all right. In fact, I’ve had people volunteer to come and work for mefor free, but I’ve turned them down because I knew what they were up to.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Namely, what? Jamieson: They wanted to pick my brain and then just take off and start their ownpartnerships. Why should I work with someone who had no real commitmentto stay?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why are you good at what you do? Jamieson: Well, I’m demanding; I have high personal standards. I have a better balancebetween quantitative and intuitive decision-making. It always used to botherme that, to use an example, Reid Dennis was as intuitive as he was andprobably still is, but I understand much more now why he was that way, notthat I would go as far toward the intuitive balance as he has or did. But Iunderstand, really much more what role intuition can play in makinginvestment decisions, and I find that the more it’s used the better it gets.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you think that’s a function of experience? Jamieson: Experience in—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Living. When you talk about intuition, you’re meaning in sizing up otherpeople? Jamieson: Yes, of course, right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, don’t you think most people get better at that as they get older? 50 Jamieson: Well, I never thought about it that way! [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Maybe I’m being very stereotypical, and I’m sure you will tell me if I am, butI don’t think of engineers, which you were in the beginning, as particularlyprizing intuition. Jamieson: I think as a generalization, that’s quite true. Sure. We’re much more thingsand numbers-oriented than people-oriented, and maybe I was that way to afault at some point.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, you obviously have learned— Jamieson: Oh I hope so.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I mean more than all the facts that you obviously have acquired over theyears, but learning that intuition is a part of the equation. Was there anythingthat might have sparked your realization that intuition was important as wellas knowing the hard facts? Jamieson: Well, one more or less extreme example of using intuition was that at Sigmawe talked to a group wanting to start a company named Vermeer[Technologies, Inc.]. They wanted to start it on two coasts, which we thoughtdidn’t make any sense. The founder [chuckling] was quite a difficult characterto deal with. I don’t think he ever appeared at a meeting in anything but jeansand a t-shirt. And we had a number of meetings with him and other membersof the management team. We said that we wouldn’t invest unless they choseto start the company on one coast, and we didn’t care which as long as theirgroup was all together. They agreed to that, and my partners, as I recall, stillhad some significant doubts. I did too. But I remember one partnershipmeeting in which I said, “Okay. We’re going to back this group.” And I’dnever said anything like that before! And it was just a feeling that there wasenough drive and technological skills to lead to a success. Well, to make along story short, after about two or two-and-a-half years, we sold the companyto Microsoft for $130 million in stock, following which the stock quadrupled.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh my heavens! Jamieson: So it turned into a very successful deal. We probably didn’t have enoughmoney in it as we should have, in retrospect, but that’s always the problem.One can never have too much in a good deal or too little in a bad deal. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you have any clue as to why you had that insight or intuition, which youobviously felt was new to you. Jamieson: Yes. I just was very convinced of his brilliance, and I had no—or I shouldn’tsay no—little confidence in his ability to run a company. But I thought wecould surround him— Well, some of his team had better management skills,and I thought we could surround him, over time, with enough managementskills to make the business run. I really never thought we would wind upselling it to Microsoft. I thought it was strong enough to eventually go public,but it was a very happy ending.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And why did it get sold to Microsoft? Jamieson: Well, we got a very favorable price.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It was too good to resist. Jamieson: Too good to turn down.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: If you don’t mind, I’m going to ask you some very direct questions aboutinvestment strategy. Jamieson: Sure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And then we’ll pick up the companies that you want to talk about. Myquestions are very basic. I want to know what are the prime things that you’relooking for when you consider an investment. Jamieson: In the area in which I’ve been most active I would say technological andmanagement skills, commitment, and integrity.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And at some point intuition about the entrepreneur, right? Jamieson: Oh I was speaking about what qualities I’m looking for. Yes, all right. I haveto feel confidence and trust in the person or people that we’re backing.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And that’s a very intuitive thing, isn’t it?  Jamieson: Very much so.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, so at a certain level, you’ve had to use intuition all along, have you not?Because you have to deal with people. Jamieson: In the pre-PC days, a lot could be revealed in a business plan. Now, usingExcel, it’s so easy to crank out many, many business plans that they are muchless revealing in terms of integrity or thoughtfulness than they used to be.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So you did put a lot of credence into the business plan. Jamieson: I still do. But it’s easy to ratio-test business plans and see whether they areinternally consistent or not. And in spite of Excel, some people can’t seem tomanage that to work out. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And you catch that? Jamieson: Sure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And what do you mean by ratio test? Jamieson: Oh for instance if you measure inventory turns or inventories versus sales,there’s a range of inventory turns per year which is reasonable orunreasonable.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Are you a little unusual in paying close attention to such parameters? Jamieson: I don’t really know. I don’t know how other venture capitalists makedecisions. They don’t ask me and I don’t ask them! [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why is that? Jamieson: Maybe it’s a trade secret. Who knows? I don’t know.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I’m just getting to know some venture capitalists, but I would think that— Inmost fields, there’s a lot of shop talk.  Jamieson: There are among some other people, but maybe I’m not good at that. I don’tknow; I’ve never relied on it particularly.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, well, maybe you’re just satisfied with the way you go about it. Jamieson: I could be more congenial. Maybe I’m too much of a loner.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, well, maybe you like to be in control, too. Jamieson: In terms of wanting to run companies I invest in, absolutely not, absolutelynot.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is that so? But what about running your own business? You prefer it to be inyour own hands? Jamieson: Sure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why doesn’t that attitude apply towards companies? Jamieson: Well, if one invests in businesses with the intent to run them, one cannot makemany investments. [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Right. It’s as simple as that. Jamieson: Not that I’m recommending shot-gunning deals in constructing a portfolio.But one has to have leverage in investing in companies, and there’s no pointin carefully analyzing and considering entrepreneurs if one intends to run thecompany himself anyhow. Why bother?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, that’s true. On the other hand, I’ve been learning from your generationof venture capitalists that it is not simply a matter of investment. It’s a matterof building companies. Jamieson: Well, not everyone. Other people follow the shot-gunning approach. In fact, Idon’t know if I told you this in the first meeting, but at one point before Sigmastarted, I was approached by Schroders, the famous English banking firm. Ididn’t tell you that? <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I don’t think so, no. Jamieson: Anyhow, I met with one of their vice presidents. We had a very pleasantlunch. They wanted someone to start a venture capital arm for them in theU.S., and we discussed styles of business. Their wish, at the time, was to havetheir venture business run in a style of making many investments in the hopethat a few of them would turn out to be big bangs.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh I see. Jamieson: And when I heard that I just said, “Well, I’m sorry, that certainly is a businessstrategy.” I think he was probably thinking of 3i [Group], the then favorablywell-known English venture firm which happened to be public also, and theirstyle was to do many deals and hope that a few would turn out well. At leastthat’s how I interpret their style. I said, “Well—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did it work out for them? Jamieson: Well, in the long term it didn’t work out very well at all, because they were ina lot of trouble. I did invest in a partnership in Germany that was sold to themat the peak of the market, and they proceeded to perform not very well at all. So anyhow, I said, “Well, that’s a style, and it’s not one that I want to follow.So I don’t think we have much more to talk about.” And we each went ourown ways. That was fine.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Can you say something about how you usually enter into the management of acompany? You’re usually sitting on the board, right? Jamieson: Sure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So part of your job is giving management advice? Jamieson: Or in extreme cases to hire or fire the CEO. [chuckling] Too bad, butsometimes it works out to be the latter.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is that usually an agonizing situation?  Jamieson: Sure. I was on one board where I recognized that we had a CEO problem, andit took me about a year to convince the board that without making a CEOchange, we were not going to do well at all. In the meantime I was called a lotof fairly unpleasant names.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I’ve heard statements like that before from the people I’ve talked with. Peoplein general don’t like to have to fire people. Jamieson: No.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is that because of the human cost? Jamieson: It’s because of swapping a known for an unknown.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see. Jamieson: And I think there’s a tendency to think of well, we can get along with Mr. X.He may have some negative qualities but he also has some good ones, andlet’s try to work around the weak ones and emphasize the good ones.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, you were doing that a little in the company that you decided intuitivelyto invest in. You found a brilliant man, and you would put people around himthat could counter his deficiencies, is the way I interpreted it. Jamieson: Sure, but that company had never gotten to the stage where his managementskills got much of a test, in that we sold it to Microsoft before it really had togo through the agony of being a public company. So that was fortunate for us,and fortunate for him.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: In a general sense, is there more to be said about what you feel a venturecapitalist’s responsibility is as a board member? Jamieson: I don’t feel that in terms of action it should be any different from any otherboard member. The fact is though that other board members rarely take theinterest in the companies on whose boards they sit that venture capitalists do,because venture capitalists have significant money at stake in the success ofthe company. In fact, I make the general comment that CEOs of othercompanies, who sit on boards, typically don’t have the time to spend outsideof board meetings and really understanding what’s going on, what’s reallyhappening. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Does the responsibility of investing other people’s money weigh on yoursoul? Jamieson: Oh yes—probably too much. I’m too serious about it; I’m glad not to havethat responsibility now.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is that one reason why you have drifted away from venture capitalinvestment? Jamieson: No, it’s simply because I like to do things I think I can make money at. I don’tfeel that the illiquidity or the profit opportunity in venture capital in thiscentury so far makes up for the lack of liquidity. It doesn’t make sense in myhumble estimation.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Talk a little about due diligence and what you might do in connection withlooking at a new possible investment. Jamieson: Well, we’ve talked about some of it so far. One aspect I didn’t particularlymention is reference checking. And I would say most venture funds don’t doenough of it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And that means picking up the phone? Jamieson: Yes, picking up the phone, sure. Making cold calls, talking initially to thereferences whose names you’ve gotten from the subject. But then getting fromthem the other names that you didn’t get [initially]. That’s a skill that I don’tthink many people have. Simply calling a list of references that one is givenby the subject is— It means something, or what they say means something,but you really have to get to the names you didn’t get [from the entrepreneur].<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And that, I would think, would be greatly helped by your experience in thefield, just knowing who to go to. Jamieson: I would say I certainly used to, but I’ve been out of the field for so long Idon’t view myself as being current. I do recall one case at Sigma where wewere looking at an opportunity, and one of my partners was doing the work.He made something like twenty reference checks, and they all seemed fine,and he felt this was enough. There was one that bothered me, or one aspectthat I didn’t feel we covered. I said, “Well, just make one more call,” and identified who to call. Well, we found that the company really didn’t own thepatents that it claimed to.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That’s rather a large gap. Jamieson: Sure. So that was a very good lesson.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was that intuitive on your part? Did you just sense that there was somethingwrong? Jamieson: I had no specific idea of what it was we didn’t know; I just had a feeling therewas something we really hadn’t covered thoroughly enough.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Remarkable. Jamieson: Well, it was lucky. It was very lucky. I’ll give you another one of my maxims,incidentally, which is: The battle in life is to get smarter faster than you’regetting older.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] That’s a good one! Jamieson: Sure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How important is it to you to have knowledge of the technology of thecompany that you’re investing in? Jamieson: Well, one obviously doesn’t want to feel that he knows more about thetechnology than the management of the company. But I’d say it’s important toknow enough not to be fooled. For instance, I can recall interviewing anothermember of a management team who considered himself, I guess, a futurist. Hesaid—this was back probably in the eighties— “At some point, people willhave cellular radios the size of a wristwatch. They’ll just wear them on theirarm.” And I said, “Well.” “And they would communicate through satellite.” Isaid, “Oh that’s very interesting. Well, how will they communicate?” “Ohthey’ll communicate using infrared.” I said, “Oh that’s even more interesting.What will they do when it rains?” [chuckling] Well, he obviously was makingup a story that sounded clever but it didn’t make any sense. So he was byebye. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, as far as I know, you haven’t invested in biologically based companies.Is that true? Jamieson: Well, we did one at Sigma, but I have no knowledge—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because you don’t have that kind of background. Jamieson: No, and I could be fooled. So why should I invest in things I don’t knowanything about.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It makes sense to me. By implication you’ve talked about people skills. On theother hand, you’ve talked about yourself as a—what word did you use? Not anisolationist— Jamieson: Demanding?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: No. Jamieson: I could be more congenial or collaborative.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, congenial, I think that was the word. Then my question is, where arepeople skills in this whole array? Jamieson: Mine?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, yours. I think some people probably prioritize that more than I’mimagining that you do. Jamieson: Oh, I value them in other people.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Look at Pitch Johnson, for example, who seems to me to be an extrovert,seems to love people. Jamieson: Sure, right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: He’s a different personality than you are.  Jamieson: Sure. Well, he and I would probably make a good team if we could stand eachother! [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Reid Dennis has a different approach than you do to investment. And some ofthat, I think, is personality. Do you? Jamieson: Absolutely, and I was trying to express how wrong my thinking was at thatpoint in my career, that intuition really wasn’t nearly as important as morequantitative things. I was wrong.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, you were very clear about that, I think. And yet you also said you didn’tbelieve in going as far as Reid did. Jamieson: No, I don’t believe in ignoring quantitative things or ignoring referencechecks.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And of course it’s hard to dissect all this out, isn’t it? Jamieson: I don’t mean to say that Reid does either of those. I’m just saying—that’s anextreme.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You were very clear in talking about your early life that you were headed at avery early age to a technical background.There are many things that feed in toform the way you go about life, the way you consequently go about yourbusiness. Jamieson: Sure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But personality is one of the things that goes into it. Jamieson: That’s right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I’m stating the obvious, aren’t I? [chuckling]Did you read many, many, many business plans? Jamieson: Oh sure. We used to track them in one partnership, and my recollection is—I’m not sure—I think in one year we got 500 or 600. 60<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How would you select? Jamieson: Well, you scan them. One of my other maxims about people writing businessplans is never write more than twenty pages. If you can’t get the messageacross in twenty pages, you don’t know what you’re talking about.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, and nobody’s going to read it. Jamieson: No one will take the time to read more than that. And only some fraction ofthe people that get it will get through the whole twenty pages. But that’s amaximum not an optimum.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Are you conscious that you are, in a sense, a repository of an incredibleamount of technical and business and financial information? Because of justwhat you have to survey. Jamieson: Sure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is that a consciousness that you have? Jamieson: Well, my objective is to know everything about everything.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] That might be a little difficult. Jamieson: I’m a compulsive reader, for instance, as I think I said. Giving me a book islike offering a drink to an alcoholic.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It seems to me that the venture capital industry, because it must select certaininvestments over others, that there’s a huge wastage of information that youdon’t act upon. Is that knowledge about a variety of companies, only a veryfew of which can you possibly invest in, then lost? What happens to it? Whenyou think about the venture capital industry in general, there’s a tremendousamount of accumulated technological, business, financial, economicinformation—even information about people. Are you, as an industry, or evenmore grandly, are we as a nation, taking full advantage of this body ofknowledge? Jamieson: Well, technologically, who knows. There’s so much of it that it’s hard to givean answer to that. I will say though that I think the U.S. government seems to me to be completely unaware of the importance of encouraging startups andsmall companies. Many of the actions that are being taken in regulation andtaxation are very, very negative for small companies, very negative.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And you’re referring to the Obama administration? Jamieson: Yes, sure. But the causes extend back into the 1990s, the causes of the generalproblem of an overleveraged economy, where the leverage is now collapsing.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And do you really think the actions are directed at startups? Or is it more wehave a problem with the way our economic system is structured, and we needto make some corrections, and it ends up having repercussions for newcompanies? Jamieson: I think we have a problem of indirect damage or lack of insight or thinking onthe part of Congress and the appointed officials in general.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What are your organizations doing about that? I was going to get to yourconnection with the Western Association of Venture Capitalists. Jamieson: Oh that was years ago. I have no connection now with the venture capitalbusiness.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do the WAVC and the National Venture Capital Association both havelobbying activities? Jamieson: Well, NVCA did. As I say, I’m so disconnected now, I don’t know.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I was just wondering who’s there in Washington representing venturecapital? Jamieson: Oh, I think the representation is very weak. And I say that without reallyknowing what it is. I just go by what I read in the press about anyrepresentation for small companies and startups, and I see literally next tonothing.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That reminds me of an article I read in the New York Times, July 7, 2009,“Venture Capitalists Look for Return to the ABCs.” The article seems toimply that your generation’s way of doing venture capital, some peopleadvocate is what the industry should return to. Did you see this?  Jamieson: No, I didn’t.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [Quoting] “Our biggest challenge today for venture capital is to think smaller,to go back to the basics. That many firms are trying to back too many differentstartups.” In other words, spreading themselves too thin. Jamieson: Well, I think there’s a simple solution to that! [chuckling] Don’t raise so muchmoney. The business is ten times or more the size that it was when it wassuccessful. There’s too much money chasing too few competententrepreneurs. That’s the problem. And once their money is raised, there’spressure to invest, invest, invest, and be more fee-dependent than successdependent.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, maybe the economic downturn is going to solve that problem. Jamieson: It will certainly help, yes, sure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Are there other things that you’d like to say about how venture capital is donenow, as opposed to how it was when you were practicing it? Jamieson: Well, I think the biggest problem is that the supply of capital has been elastic.The supply of capable entrepreneurs is not elastic; it doesn’t rise to make useof available capital. So a larger percentage of capital gets invested inrelatively less successful or less competent entrepreneurs.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It’s a matter of people having ideas that can build businesses, and there’s justa certain level of that competency, and it’s not in sync with the money? Jamieson: No, not at all. And you say, is there any evidence of that? Well, I just point tothe rates of return; they’re lower because there’s too much capital. There’s anoversupply of capital versus entrepreneurial competence.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is it too simplistic to say that that goes back to the time of the bubble? Jamieson: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It appeared that there was endless money so you got all these people cominginto the field.  Jamieson: Right, sure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So then you could also conclude that there must also have been people comingin who didn’t have the background or the experience, right? Jamieson: A lot of people who did not have track records or experience were able toraise venture capital funds. It was just a big demand for venture capital fundsbased on what happened in the eighties and nineties.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I think of Al Gore— Jamieson: You think of—Al Gore?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Al Gore, who was brought in as a general partner at Kleiner Perkins. And anumber of scientists that I’ve talked to about their science have since becomeventure capitalists. Jamieson: Well, Al Gore isn’t a scientist. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, yes, I think of him first and foremost as a politician. Jamieson: Yes, he is.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is this legitimate, in the sense of adding real value to a partnership? Jamieson: You mean turning politicians into venture capitalists?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes. Does it really add much, or is it just window dressing that brings a lot ofmedia attention? Jamieson: I think it shows an increasing tendency to depend on influence versus otherfactors in the business.I have a question to ask you when we start the next tape! Since we’re on thesubject of Al Gore! [laughter][End Audio File 3] <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It is still July 28, 2009, and I’m still talking with Mr. Jamieson. Jamieson: Well, we were talking about Al Gore and venture capital. And my nextquestion to you was going to be, do you believe in global warming? [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I do, and I’m certainly not able to tell you from a highly technical basiswhy I do. But I do know people in the field who have the statistics that theyclaim show that, while the planet has had cycles of warming and cooling, theway the cycles are behaving now are abnormal and that there is a humancomponent to it. And I believe that. Jamieson: All right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You don’t? Jamieson: Well, what I believe is that the Al Gore version of global warming iscompletely fallacious. I think it’s another measure of monumental humanconceit in thinking that we have the extent of influence on climate that Gorewould claim that we do. I don’t think we do at all. I just would go back andmake the point that in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, Greenland waswarmer than it is today. Well, why is it colder? Well, not because of anythingwe’ve done, because all we’ve had since then is a significant amount in recentcenturies of expansion of industrial activity at the sacrifice of agriculturalactivity. So I believe that global warming or cooling is much more influenced bythings over which man has no control, like sunspot activity, for instance.Sunspot activity now is at a recent all-time low, and generally that’s been agood predictor, over a few hundred years, of global cooling. In fact, last yearwas a year of very heavy snowfall in Europe; there’s a lot of mention ofwhat’s happening to the Arctic ice cap. I don’t see any mention of the fact thatthe Antarctic ice cap is expanding. A few years ago I was climbing on theglacier [Perito] Moreno, in Argentina—it’s in the southern hemisphere, ofcourse, and it’s a glacier that’s expanding, not shrinking. So I don’t know. Iwould say I don’t know, but I do think that there’s a lot of conceit inoverestimating how much influence human activity can have.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, without defending Gore—and I’m not in any position where I couldeven if I wished to—I think he was behaving as a politician much more than as a scientist. And he had, for whatever reason, decided to make globalwarming his crusade, and he wanted to make a political point. Jamieson: Oh I think he happens to have made tens of millions of dollars with this idea,so I have to congratulate him on his entrepreneurial skills. But I just think it’sall wrong.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, Mr. Jamieson, he’s now one of your own, as a so-called venturecapitalist. [chuckling] Jamieson: Well, I’m not a venture capitalist! See, he’s come in, and I, ten years ago, left.[laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: All right, never the twain shall meet.I want to get back, though, to the discussion we were just having off-tape. Icondense it to your statement that there’s too much money in current venturecapital for its own good. Jamieson: Too much money supply relative to the entrepreneurial supply.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So, the question is, how do we increase the innovative power, theentrepreneurial power of the United States of America? Jamieson: Well, we start off by increasing the educational standards. Without that as afoundation, all else I think is hopeless. I think the K-12 public educationalsystem is an absolute disaster. I think I knew more as an eighth grade graduatethan many high school graduates know today. We had much more effectivestandards applied and much more emphasis on basics when I was in grammarschool than the poor children—when I say poor I mean educationally poor notfinancially pool—the poor children have today. There’s too much money spent on administration, spent on multiple languageprograms, which is nonsense. The glue that made America work as a meltingpot was language. Different languages split culture; they do not unite it. It’s agreat fallacy. I know when my grandfather, my mother’s father, emigratedfrom Germany in 1883, one of the great initial emphases was to learn English.Well, by providing instruction in other languages— My mother didn’t speakEnglish till she started kindergarten. So she was basically made to learnEnglish as soon as she started school, which was great. She never complainedto me about it. In fact, by the time I was around, she pretty much lost a lot ofher German. I think I’ve mentioned, I took four years of German in high school, and I lost it. I really only took it because I had to take some language.It’s just pretty unusual that we were reading Goethe in German during WorldWar II.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: All right. Shall we turn to specific companies? Jamieson: Sure. Whatever you’d like.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You mentioned Tigon, which is a games company. Jamieson: No, Tigon was a pager company.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But when you look on the Website now, there are a whole bunch of games. Ordo I have the wrong company? Jamieson: I think you do. The short story is Tigon was founded by a technologist. It gotinto trouble by basically— Pagers are rented not sold, or were. They are anobsolete product now. No one that I know of uses pagers. Why should one?So the company was a difficult cash-flow business to manage. There was agreat churn rate, and the monthly rentals were low; there was a trackingproblem—where is the pager? That is a company asset, not a sold asset. Anyhow, one of my limited partners had invested— It was obvious that thecompany was just going to go bankrupt if something wasn’t done. He askedme to invest and go on the board. I said I would. We fairly rapidly found anew marketing-oriented CEO with some business school skills, worked withhim, and about a year-and-a-half later the company was sold to Ameritech fora very favorable price. So it was a relatively fast in-and-out effort, but we hadvery frequent board meetings and the company was in Texas.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you think that you saved the company? Jamieson: I think I and some other board changes brought about the managementchanges that were needed, yes. We needed a stronger hand than the previousboard had had. I think that probably the founder had a number of his friendson the board, and they didn’t really recognize the cash-flow problems. So wehad no grandiose plan to grow a huge company in a short time, because thatreally can’t be done in a rental business. There are other examples of failuresof low-value products going way back to things like IBM DiskPacs. Theywere rented for $15 a month or so, and it was a hopeless business model, <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, explain why you can’t build a big company on a rental product. Jamieson: Oh, because the revenue for each product shipped is not the value of thatproduct; it’s some fraction of the value based on the rental rate. If a product isworth $1,000, it might rent for $50 a month, so instead of getting $1,000 whenyou manufacture a product, you get $50. It doesn’t work for very long.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You spoke of the limited partner. Would you never have made that investmentif it had been left up to you, knowing that it was based on a rental product? Jamieson: [pause to think] Yes, because I knew of the problem years before with IBMDiskPacs, which were impossible for anyone to engage in renting other thanIBM.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What do you do in the case, as you were describing, where there are friends orcolleagues of the questionable CEO on the board? Am I not right in thinkingthat any decision made has to be by majority vote? Jamieson: Sure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So did you have to do a lot of persuading? Jamieson: It’s the golden rule operating: He who has the gold makes the rules. [<|endoftext|>
Interviewerlaughs] So if a company is running out of money, you have a lot of influence.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So did it really come down to that? Jamieson: Sure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you have to threaten to withdraw? Jamieson: No, I was not an investor. I came in as a part of a refinancing in theorganization.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see, because I couldn’t understand how this investment happened in the firstplace.  Jamieson: Well, I was certainly influenced by our lead limited partner with whom I hadhad years of friendship, having already money at risk. But the terms of thenew investment were favorable enough to make it worthwhile doing, at leasttaking a risk.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Thinking of the boards of companies in which you are an investor— Jamieson: Well, there are none now, except charitable boards or cultural boards.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you have to resort on occasion to, “I’m an investor in this company, andI’m going to disappear unless you do as I say?” Jamieson: No. The crisis occurs when the company is running out of money. What youcan say is, “Well, unless certain changes are made, we’re not going to give thecompany more money.” So it’s not a matter of threatening to leave; there’s noleverage there. They would say, “Okay. Go ahead.” [laughter] “We don’t needyou and we don’t need your money.”<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because your investment is already there, and it behooves you to stick with it. Jamieson: That’s right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Anything more about Tigon? Jamieson: No. It was a quick in-and-out story with a very happy ending for all.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Then you mentioned FileNet. When was that founded? Jamieson: 1982.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Tigon was about the same era? You don’t have to be precise. Jamieson: I don’t know when it was founded, but it was an involvement for me that wassometime during the eighties. Since we sold it trade sale, I don’t have thedates in mind.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It doesn’t matter. So FileNet.  Jamieson: FileNet was a company of which I was actually a founder as well as being aninvestor, and that was originally one of the Jamieson and Companyinvestments. But FileNet was started by the former executive vice president ofSycor, the company of which I was COO in the early seventies.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Right, I remember. Jamieson: He went through a couple of other affiliations after Sycor and then left acompany called Basic Four, which was in the small business systems marketand asked me work with him in looking around for a company to buy. Well,we soon found that companies that were for sale had some problem, like thetechnology was becoming obsolete. So we came across—I don’t know quite what to call it—an archival records ordata storage company using what we thought were primitive means. FileNetwas started as a means to approach the paperless office. Well, we weren’tsuccessful in getting rid of paper, but we got rid of a lot of it. The product wasa large system using optical disks to provide archival storage of documents. Itstarted in ’82. I had 1 percent of the founders’ shares, for which I agreed to alockup of—I think it was five years—and to be the lead investor and got thecompany financed. I stayed on the board from ’82 to ’94. Ted Smith, who wasthe founder, ran the company very well, but it had a lot of ups and downs. Itwent public in ’87 just at the time of the great market drop of ’87, which wasfortunately a V drop—down fast and up fast.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You wouldn’t have gone public, if you had been able to see that that coming? Jamieson: No. It was a reaction to interest rates going up very rapidly.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see, and so the price of the stock dropped precipitously? Jamieson: Well, it was a difficult time to go public. The lead underwriter I think wasMorgan Stanley. I think the personality involved was Frank Quattrone, whowas very famous as an investment banker. He ran into some legal problemslater on.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] Yes, I remember. Jamieson: But it was the summer of ’87 when FileNet was going public, and I think thatmarket crash occurred in late August or early September. It was very 70dramatic. But that was a difficult climate to begin with. And like many smallcompanies, FileNet’s earnings had a lot of variability. Among other things, wegot sued by the usual people who enter into class action suits againstcompanies for not representing their future prospects accurately, and basicallythey want to be paid to go away. So the person that did that eventually woundup in jail—I mean the lawyer who made that his business.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Made the class action suit. Jamieson: Yes, made a business of class action suits. It turned out he was bribingclaimants and basically creating these cases.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Wow. Jamieson: So we went through things like that. In ’94 the board made the decision tobring in a new CEO. One came from IBM. I’d had a long relationship withSmith; I liked him a lot. I just didn’t want to go through the effort of creating agood working relationship with a new CEO, so I left the board. But in the latenineties the company was acquired by IBM for $1.4 billion, so that turned outwell.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That was all right, and you had founders’ stock. Jamieson: Yes, I had founders’ stock. I and other directors were very involved indiscussing strategy and actions with the management. It was a goodexperience.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: If it was a good experience, management, I’m presuming, was receptive. Jamieson: Sure, yes. Well, they weren’t rolling over at every idea that we had, but it waspossible to have discussions without them getting acrimonious.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Has that been your usual experience? That executives, managers, are receptiveto your advice? Jamieson: Yes, I’d say the worst experience in that way was R2 Systems. It took a yearfor me to convince the board that the CEO was as bad as I thought he was. Inthe first place, he wasn’t truthful, and it was not a happy experience in thatway. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Truthful in the sense of trying to make the company look better than itactually was? Jamieson: Sure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And the other board members couldn’t see that? Jamieson: Well, all I can say is they didn’t. [chuckling]Another very active venture investor, Scott Halstead, eventually wound upbecoming chairman of the company. Another board member was interimpresident, and we found a very good marketing-oriented executive who hadbeen with a U.S. division of Siemens, who came in. We wound up selling thecompany to Hologic for between $200-$300 million dollars. The product wasa computer-based image-analyzing system that replaced second readers formammograms and allowed much more accurate early detection of breastcancer. And I think it’s the current standard of care. If I were a woman, Iwould not go to a mammographic center that did not have an R2 system.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I will take that advice in mind.You mentioned underwriters, and we haven’t talked about underwriting at all.Who makes the decision about which underwriter for which IPO? Jamieson: The board does.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And why one over another? Jamieson: It’s based on track record of successful IPOs of small companies; it’s based onresearch coverage in the future. It’s more of an intuitive decision thananything else, I guess I would say.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Intuition again. Do you favor certain underwriters over others? Do you havefavorites? Jamieson: Well, the business has changed so in just the last few years. Some companiesthat were effective are gone; some were acquired. Merrill Lynch was acquiredby Bank of America. So many that I would have felt favorably about in thepast are either gone, merged, acquired, or they would have no interest in small IPOs. Again, there’s been a tremendous scale-up of capital in the investmentbanking business as well as the venture business.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So is it true that some investment banks can’t be bothered with small IPOs? Jamieson: Sure, always has been. In fact, I would have favored a medium or modest-sizeone in the past, versus a very large one, because small companies tend to getlost in very large investment banking firms.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It would take a certain kind of expertise in the underwriter in taking a GM— Jamieson: Oh, that was a very good example. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, that wasn’t the best, was it! [laughter] Jamieson: No, I’m just kidding you. No, they have to be risk takers. Sure. Much morethan doing a large deal. But on the other hand, the commissions are muchhigher for initial IPOs than for established companies—maybe twice as much.So there is money to be made.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What are you looking for when you’re considering taking a company public? Jamieson: Well, has it gotten to the stage where its revenues and earnings are reasonablypredictable? Sometimes we think they are, but then they turn out not to be asin the case of FileNet. FileNet systems represented a substantial capitalinvestment on the part of companies, so their revenue stream was very lumpy.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And the condition of the market, I’m assuming, as FileNet also illustrated.You hit it wrong, as it turned out. Jamieson: Yes, that’s right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Anything else that goes into your thinking? Jamieson: Well, it’s confidence in management and management’s ability to run a largercompany— <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Right, with a lot of public scrutiny. Jamieson: —at the time it goes public.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I would think that’d be a huge step for an executive. Jamieson: It’s a big responsibility.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Also I’m thinking of the new public face and the public reporting, and all ofthat. Jamieson: That’s right. Fortunately I think it’s under-realized by most CEOs. [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Or they’d never do it? Jamieson: But we don’t tell them.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, but they stand to gain too. Jamieson: Yes. Their focus is on what their stock is going to be worth as opposed towhat they have to pay for it, pay for it in terms of responsibility.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You don’t necessarily go into that in great detail? Jamieson: No. It’s something you can’t explain very well anyhow. And how it’s viewedis oftentimes a function of the individual. There are certainly some that havebeen CEOs of companies that have gone public without much sense ofresponsibility to the public shareholders. So it’s difficult to convey.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: All right. LDT [Laser Diagnostic Technologies]. Jamieson: All right. It was another example of a— Well, several examples. Thecompany got, I think, bad advice from its board in that it had an expensiveproduct. This was a laser for analyzing nerve bundle in eyes, a laser system.This was sold to ophthalmologists. It was initially sold, but then someone,either in the company or on the board, got the idea that—“Oh, we could rentthese.” Well, I don’t know who the originator was, but the board agreed to it. Well, immediately, the company started to incur a big, negative cash flow.Well, of course.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You could have told them that. Jamieson: That’s what happens when you rent products—expensive products or productsthat—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were you advising against renting? Jamieson: No, I wasn’t on the board. One of my original partners was, who had reallygeneral business competence but, let’s say, not in the quantitative sense oflooking at what happens to a balance sheet when you rent rather than sell. At the same time, as we found out later, the CEO as well as running thecompany had been working on a startup of a new company at the expense ofour company. So we didn’t think too well of that. [chuckling]In the meantime, before we even knew this, we had recruited a much betterCEO who was also very good at listening to the board. Oh—and the boardcompletely changed at that time. When the company had to be refinanced, hecame to us with this rental scheme. We said, “No, thanks,” at Sigma. But thenwe eventually did invest because the company had to be reengineered. Theboard had 100 percent turnover, and we pointed out the fallacy of the rentalconcept, although there were also a lot of product-quality problems. Weprovided advice on how to do the reengineering that was required withoutanother financing being required. The quality problems got turned around; thecompany stopped renting; the returns due to quality problems decreased. At the time I got on the board, the other investors were willing to sell thecompany, would be delighted to sell the company for $10 million. After, Ithink a year and a half to two years, there was enough progress in solving allthe problems so that we sold it to [Carl] Zeiss Meditec for $28 million.Basically, we just wanted to get out of it because, even though it was getting alot better, there were still plenty of problems ahead. So that was a niceturnaround.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Good. We’re running out of time, and there are some other things that I wantto ask you. Jamieson: Go right ahead. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: One of them being the importance, or not, of California as a setting. Yourearly career was on the East Coast. So I would be interested in hearing yourthoughts on how not only venture capital, but how innovation and newcompany growth happen in both areas of our country. Jamieson: Well, it didn’t happen as rapidly on the East Coast or on the scale that it didhere. I think early on I may have commented about the differences betweenMIT and Stanford. For some reason MIT never was able to mechanize thebusiness-generation activity that Stanford did, and I mentioned ProfessorTerman at Stanford as being a leading light, and making that happen, andrealizing how important it was. Also, on the West Coast there was theexample of Hewlett-Packard, which was a private company for really quite afew years in context of modern timescale, that turned into a very large andvery successful public company.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did it become more or less a model for a high-tech company? Jamieson: That’s right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: The East Coast has Route 128, an industrial area. Jamieson: Right. But in total revenue in employment, I don’t think it’s nearlyapproached the scale of activity here.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What about the type of activity that occurs along Route 128 compared toSilicon Valley? Jamieson: Well, years ago there were more manufacturing companies there rather thannow, where I think it’s mainly a research-oriented economy. Athough theincrease in biotech companies, in more recent years, has changed that and hasbeen more favorable. But biotech companies never employ the legions ofpeople that large manufacturing companies do.On the other hand, small companies are much more responsible for increasesin employment than large companies are. Large companies are always tradingoff labor expense for capital investment, and they much prefer to replace laborwith capital. Small companies are responsible for most of the employmentgrowth in the United States.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Some people make a big deal about the culture of Silicon Valley, with all theadjectives that go along with it. Do you, having familiarity with both areas, see any validity in the contrast? I’m thinking of Route 128 as compared toSilicon Valley, if that’s the way you want to address it. Jamieson: I would say that the culture in the East is more conservative. I see manyexamples of young people here with much more money than sense. [laughter]What we call the Google kids are buying up perfectly nice houses in Athertonfor very high prices, tearing them down, and building what my wife and I calltrophy houses, which make no sense.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, trophy houses or McMansions. Jamieson: Yes. Ihave run several times into a young woman walking a dog that I like alot—I like the dog. The woman is okay too. [<|endoftext|>
Interviewer laughs] At least tell mywife that! [chuckling] Jamieson: The woman was complaining bitterly about a young couple who bought sucha perfectly good house near her, tore it down, and built a 12,000 square foothouse. And there are two of them. So does that make any sense? I don’t thinkso. In fact, fortunately we had the time or the need to design our house twice,and the second time around we made it smaller, and I’m very glad that we did.It’s less than 4,000 square feet. I forget what it is exactly, but it was good tomake it smaller.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes. Smaller—there’s some adage about that. Jamieson: That’s a house that was ahead of its time.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Meaning in what? Jamieson: In conservatism and low-maintenance design.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I think you would admit that you are a conservative person. So how has itbeen to be in a less conservative place than where you were born and bred? Jamieson: Fine. [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That’s very expansive! You seem very East Coast to me. Jamieson: Yes, I probably am. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So there hasn’t been a disjuncture? Jamieson: Well, we actually lived in Los Angeles for about four years.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, that’s even worse, isn’t it? Jamieson: Yes, it is. Although as I think I mentioned, we found a suburb that was moretraditional.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What about philanthropy? Jamieson: Oh I’m very active. [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I know about the opera because there are placards on your wall. Jamieson: Well, we support the museum just as much.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Which museum? Jamieson: The Fine Arts Museums [of San Francisco].<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: The de Young. Jamieson: Yes, the de Young and Legion of Honor.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Good for you. Jamieson: We have a gallery there that’s named for us. We’ve given three or fourpaintings to the museum. We have one on loan, so we’re very interested. Wecollect art.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I see some of that on your wall here. Jamieson: Yes. Dürer is the earliest, and our latest is probably early twentieth centuryimpressionist. We have more art than we can hang, so we circulate it. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, that’s a nice problem to have. Jamieson: Well, we don’t have a big house! [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I think I’m coming to the end. What would you like to say after all myquestions? Jamieson: Well, in terms of recommendations on lifestyle or personal attitude it’s: Bemore than you seem to be.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I thank you. Jamieson: And don’t believe your own press notices! [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I thank you. Jamieson: Thank you
