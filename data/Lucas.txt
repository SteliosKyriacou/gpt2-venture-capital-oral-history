Interviewer: It is March 10, 2010!Lucas: Ye gods! We lost a year quickly! [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And I am talking to Mr. Donald L. Lucas, the first interview. Mr. Lucas, let usstart back with your family and what it was like to grow up in the household,wherever it was. Give me a feeling of what your childhood and education waslike.Lucas: So how long should this be? [laughter] No, I'm serious. Two minutes?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, let's say ten minutes.Lucas: Okay. I was born in Upland, California. My family—they were ranchers inSouthern California. And on the Lucas side they started in Belgium, and theywent to Iowa. You know the Belgian horses—the big horses? Well, theyraised them there, and then went to Iowa, then went out to Cucamonga,California and started ranching.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And about when was that?Lucas: Oh that would be—I don't want to be too precise—but 1870, something likethat timeframe. On my mother's side, they were from Alsace-Lorraine,German-French. My grandfather had a big beard and he was old—when Iknew him he was about ninety-four, ninety-five years old. He had led wagontrains across, and he was very proud he never had to kill an Indian. And he leda number across to California, so pioneers.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: From the Midwest.Lucas: From the Midwest. So in a way, we're pioneer California. And there weren'tvery many people out there. We raised grapes, and out of the grapes we madewine, and then we had peaches and oranges and apricots.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How much land? Lucas: Fifteen hundred acres. The milk ranch was down in Chino, which is south ofCucamonga, and I didn't spend much time there. My father was presidentbecause he had the greatest number of shares. So I worked on the ranch andstarted working there—we were, of course, all broke during the Depression.What we've been through now, it doesn't seem like much. I mean, we werereally broke then. But fortunately, we had some food to eat.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because you were growing it.Lucas: Exactly, but I started working at twelve years old at the ranch and madetwelve and a half cents an hour and learned the value of money. Before that Ihad sold lemonade in front of the house for a dime, and the neighbors helpedmake it and they gave me the stuff free. One summer I made $55 sellinglemonade! But anyway, we were Catholic, and so I went to a Catholic grammar school. Iwas an altar boy and all that. And so I had a pretty good education. But thenright near us there was a big public high school called Chaffey Union HighSchool. I was the youngest of three boys. My older brother, John, never gotless than an A, and my middle brother [Richard]—he was the good-lookingone, and he had real cute girlfriends, but he swam, and he was more relaxedabout life. I, of course, was the baby, and I played sports. When I got into highschool, I got a B, and the teacher said, “And you're John Lucas's brother?”[laughter] And I'll never get over that. I'll never get over that. But I didn't getall A's like my brother. But my brother got his undergraduate degree at Berkeley, he got his master'sat Davis, and his PhD at UCLA.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: In what?Lucas: In engineering. And then he went to the Max Planck Institute in Berlin, andthis was when Russians were still there—it was a postdoc there. So I visitedhim there and that was a lot of fun, but that's getting ahead of the story. But heended up as number two guy at JPL [Jet Propulsion Laboratory] at Caltech; heis really smart. My mom—we called her Gogo—she was the greatest, and she lived to 103!And so all my friends up here got to know her. She was really super; she wasa great mom.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: With three boys in the family, were you all being pushed in differentdirections in terms of professions? Lucas: What happened is something called World War II.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, there was that thing.Lucas: And they went away to war, and my brother John was commissioned atAnnapolis, and my other brother Richard was a hospital corpsman in theUnited States Navy. Both of them ended up in the Pacific, but my brotherJohn almost died, of an infection. I was captain of both the football team and the basketball team, and they neversaw me play. That was sad for me because I had a lot of fun. I was vicepresident of the student body, etc. So I had a great high school—it was justidyllic. It was a public high school, so we had quite a number of Mexicansbecause there were quite a number of Mexicans in the area. And then ourfullback was black—Lucius Harvey, a great guy, and so I learned to get alongand to lead and to help others do better. And I think the sports really helpedme, in my business.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because of having to work with teams?Lucas: Working on a team. I’m a team player, very much a team player. I was very fortunate I had a scholarship—an athletic scholarship, notacademic—to Notre Dame and UCLA, USC. Then Stanford offered me one!And my advisors told me, go to Stanford. They didn’t even offer me a trip uphere, but I came and of course I haven’t regretted it, had a great time atStanford, took economics, and I really had, again, just a great time. After I graduated, I went on to Stanford Business School where I majored infinance.Lucas: I was the housemother for the fraternity which included at least a third of thefootball team. They weren’t all doing well in school, so I had to keep themquiet, and I told them I could get better grades, and they did.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, but you played football as a Stanford undergraduate.Lucas: I played football, but we didn’t do that well, unfortunately. But the year after Igraduated we went to the Rose Bowl, and that was fun. But I didn’t havemuch money, so I tutored the rich kids in undergraduate accounting. It was really very helpful, because if you can tutor somebody, it means you reallyunderstand the subject.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, that’s very true.Lucas: It’s very interesting. I would highly recommend it to anybody.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you see majoring in economics and then going on to finance in businessschool as just kind of a continuation of the business of the ranch?Lucas: Yes, I have left out—my father had a heart attack when I was young, and so Igot involved with the ranch business early on. As an example, the ranch waspaying excess profits taxes when they should have used the money to improvethe orchards instead of paying taxes.Lucas: During World War II.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why was that? Was that just standard?Lucas: That was standard, yes. We had some relatives in the business who I determined they weren’t as smartas they thought they were. So I learned about business, and I had to do a littlebit as a youngster, but nothing too severe. But I read the Fortune businessmagazines that were stacked up. Fortune used to be a great magazine, thebusiness magazine. And I played cards; I learned how to count real fast andremember things, and so all that helped.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So you were good at it, obviously.Lucas: I was good at it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But did it also grab you?Lucas: Oh I was going to be involved with finance. My grandfather had started abank in Cucamonga, but was forced out of the banking business by Bank ofAmerica! And so it kind of ran in the blood. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But your parents weren’t saying, “Now Don, you know you’ve got thisbackground, you would be—”Lucas: No, no, I did it myself.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: This was all generated by yourself.Lucas: Self, yes. But see, being the baby in the family, you know, I was spoiled. Andalso, my father wasn’t well and so Mom was busy. We didn’t have help oranything like that, so she was really busy. And so pretty well at a young age Idid my own thing.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Once your father became ill, did you become kind of the financial head of thefamily?Lucas: No, that was when I was eight years old, so that was early, that was early.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh, you were too young.Lucas: That was early, that was early. But it certainly got me on the way,progressively.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were there any long-lasting implications of the economics major at Stanford?Lucas: Oh yes, oh yes, absolutely!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How does that tie into what comes later? Or does it at all?Lucas: Economics is all encompassing. In fact, today, this instant, it’s much moreapplicable than at many other times, because we’re in deepfinancial/economic trouble today. As we go forward I can tell you how I’vebeen involved in economics. And yes, absolutely. It’s a good background.Accounting is fundamental because if you understand how the numbers cometogether, you can better understand how people maybe can cheat. Or you canbetter understand how to ask them more detailed information to learn more. Inother words, the numbers mean a lot to me, and so I could process them fasterthan most. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did that all turn out to be very helpful when you began to invest?Lucas: Yes, absolutely!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And you could look at the books and really make sense out of them in a waythat I imagine a lot of people couldn’t, including certainly myself.Lucas: Well, I don’t want to say that, but it gave me a head start. And then I went inthe army for a couple of years; I got a direct commission because I had anMBA.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Tell about that. That was the time of the Korean War?Lucas: Yes, and then I volunteered to go overseas. [chuckling] That’s when mybrother John was in Berlin, and I’d never of course been to Europe. So Ivolunteered, and if there wasn’t a space open, I was going to Korea,expedited. Fortunately, there was a space open so I went to Germany. I alsospeak some German. I spent close to two years there, and I had a great timebecause I worked for the Surgeon General of the Seventh Army, which ran allthe ground troops in Germany. So I got to see, and I have a great respectactually for the military.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And why?Lucas: They’re dedicated. They truly are dedicated to our country and to theirprofession. I was the only second lieutenant at Headquarters 7th Army, and Iwas the only non-regular army, and so I associated with the professionals.And they were professional in what they did. They weren’t perfect of course.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now you’re talking about officers?Lucas: Oh, I would just deal with officers. I ran several clubs, and that’s where I didget in touch with some of the sergeants who were a little less professional. Butthe officers—we had one who was a hero in World War II, and so we talkedabout what he did. He took on the German tanks—he’s just walking along andhe took on tanks with his grenades and all. This man had a superabundance ofcourage, so it was fun talking to him, very exciting.  And then I went to Berlin, and I asked why—we had the oxtail soup—whywas it so greasy? “Well, that’s the way the Russians like it.” So I got my tasteof the Russians, which wasn’t attractive. They have a lake there, on our side,on the west side there’s all these little sailing boats, and on the other sidethere’s no boats; that’s the Russian side. So I went in and walked around inEast Berlin. You see the war and the Wall; it was something you can’t forget.So it was a good start.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: When the Wall fell, it must have had particular meaning for you.Lucas: Oh, it was exciting, yes. To see the people penned up, so to speak, and thenyou went down Stalinallee, a broad street with a pretty façade and new and allthat. One room wide—just for show, not to live in, so that was my first tasteof the Russians. But then I came back, and I interviewed at what people told me was the bestinvestment banking firm at that time on Wall Street—the best trainingprogram was Smith Barney & Company. I came home, and they accepted me.I had Christmas at home and then I went back to work at New York. And Iwas in the corporate finance department and—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Finance because that had been your specialty?Lucas: That’s what I wanted to do, yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But you didn’t say why.Lucas: I’m sorry—to make money!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh! [laughter]Lucas: You know what they say about money—you want to be where the money is.[chuckling] Okay. You know, I was used to working, and I worked harderthan anybody else. I didn’t have any money, so that’s all I could do anyway.And so I was the most successful one in the department.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Meaning what? You had more clients and more connections? How did itwork? Lucas: Well, at that young age, you don’t have clients. This is when I was twentyfive/twenty-six.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Tell me what you were doing.Lucas: I worked for the senior partner, Charles B. [Barney] Harding, and theHardings owned a big share of the firm. And they were rich. He was a verynice person, and I traveled with him. I’d write speeches for him, and we’dtravel to a steel mill, and there’d be a client at the steel mill, like YoungstownSheet and Tube was a client. And so I’d go and learn about steel! He wasreally very nice, too. His brother was Bill Harding, William Barclay Harding.My roommate worked for him. Mr. Harding advised the Rockefellersamongst others. As you know, the Rockefellers had a lot of money and in thatgeneration were doing what amounts to venture capital.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, I read that. But they didn’t call it venture capital, right?Lucas: It was private capital, private investments—whatever you want to call it. There were three of us in a small uptown apartment. The third person wasDaniel Lee Ritchie. He worked for Robert Lehman at Lehman Brothers. So,we would often compare notes of how the two firms did some things in asimilar fashion and other things very differently. While at Smith Barney, I went down to Venezuela to look at some oil things.I was the young kid on the big oil deal. A partner, of course, was in charge.We went into Colombia, and there was a coal development project there justoff the Caribbean. The coal was located near Barranquilla. So we went to thecapital of Bogotá and that was a lot of fun. Of course I’d never been to SouthAmerica. I tried to find a small emerald—I’d heard that they have emeralds there—formy mom, but I couldn’t find a store, and I never did figure that out. I wentthrough Panamá and did gamble a little bit and was winning some money, andthen they got me high, and I lost all the money. But it was right where mywife-to-be lived—one block away from there. But then I came back home to the U.S. I had gotten to know the head of ourMinneapolis office, Ken Joas, and Kenny said, “Look, they’re starting thisnew computer company, and maybe they need some money, or something.”That’s what our business was, right? And so I went to the real smart partner inthe company, Mr. [Charles W.] Kennard, who had just recently developed theconcept of the convertible bond. This was a better way to raise money. He didthe first big subordinate convertible bonds; a bond that’s convertible into stock. That’s a convertible bond, the first ones. We were the leaders. SmithBarney was the leader. I thought he would be the appropriate person to introduce this concept of thenew computer company Control Data. I went with the president of thecompany, Mr. Norris, to meet Mr. Kennard. I will never forget it. Mr.Kennard was very patronizing and said, “No, we are not interested.” So Mr.Norris got up and walked out the door, and I ran after him. I said, “Whoa,don’t go away!” He went away and I lost the deal.Later on Mr. Joas had another deal and he said, “They’re starting this newsemiconductor company and you should look at it.” So I talked to them andkind of the same thing happened. I met with the people; it was a group thathad left Sperry Rand Semiconductor—Sperry Semiconductor in Long Island.They had gone across the bay to Danbury, Connecticut to start the company. Itsounded good to me. What I knew about semiconductors you can putunderneath your nonexistent little nail.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was that your first exposure to high-tech industry?Lucas: Control Data didn’t exist then. This was 1957, so it really hadn’t happened.Much hadn’t happened, certainly not back in New York.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Where are you with Smith Barney?Lucas: I’m in New York City, all that time in New York. The whole business was inNew York. I tried to get Smith Barney to open up out here. I wanted to goback to California.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why didn’t they? Things were beginning to happen here.Lucas: They made a big mistake, that’s what.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, I bet.Lucas: And a friend of mine, Bill [William K.] Bowes, whom you might haveinterviewed—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, I have. Lucas: Bill ran this operation for Blyth. In fact, while I was at Stanford, I had talkedto Mr. Charles Blyth about going to Wall Street. And I said, “Well, how aboutcoming to work for you, sir?” “Go back to New York and learn from the bigboys.” [chuckling] Well, I want to go back to Mr. Harding and whoever elsecame into the Smith Barney thing. I was the hardest worker in the department,and I got my work done.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And that’s what they saw?Lucas: And these were statistics.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is that what they saw in you?Lucas: Oh yes. And I did the grunt labor. I had a secretary, and she’d type them up,the preparations for pitches to get new business. We were quite successful,and I enjoyed that. I really did enjoy it a lot, but it wasn’t very creative.[chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What do you mean?Lucas: Well, I wanted to do more than just do what were called comparisons. Like inpricing something—how do you price a bond? Well, you compare thecompany with other similar companies, and so you compare their sales growthand their earnings, their profitability—all information obtained from auditreports, accounting reports.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see, so you were spending a lot of time perusing documents.Lucas: Working on numbers and doing it fast, accurately, and then helping the salespitch to the client, but the partner would do that. I would just provide him withthe background information.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now would the partners do any of this?Lucas: I do all the work. They make all the money. [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, but also isn’t there a division of knowledge? Even if they chose to, theyprobably wouldn’t have the facility with numbers that you had. Lucas: Oh these guys—they were very smart. Oh they were talented, and I learned agreat deal from them. Like when we traveled to South America, we traveledwith a lawyer from Davis Polk, a big law firm, and he thought he should havebecome the Secretary of State. So these were very accomplished people, andwe were there to win.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So you’re learning a lot, and it sounds to me as though you were beingstretched.Lucas: [pause] Not as fast as I wanted to be! [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So where is this ambition coming from?Lucas: I like to win! There’s nothing like winning. Sure! Absolutely, winning’simportant—not the only thing, but it’s quite important. It’s better than losing!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You figured that out early on, didn’t you! All right. You were getting bored, iswhat I’m picking up on.Lucas: No, I love working hard, and I love the winning, winning the account, and wewon our fair share. But remember Bill Harding, brother of the senior partner,worked with and for the Rockefellers, so there was that. And so that obviouslygot me going.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you ever actually deal with the Rockefeller group directly?Lucas: Not directly. No, my roommate did, and we talked about it at night. Mr.Lehman and his firm were big investors, important people in Wall Street, andso we would discuss it. You know kids—we’d talk.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And were you kids picking up on quite a number of differences in thephilosophies behind each of these firms?Lucas: Oh yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What kind of conversations were you having? Lucas: Well, it’s all about profits, and so this investment banking business isrelatively easy. Trying to figure out whether or not this coal mine in Colombiais a good deal or not—that’s complicated. And just to finish that story: theyhave just started production some fifty plus years later. I was a little ahead ofmy time. [laughter] Or the promoter was a little ahead of his time.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So you came back from that trip thinking it was a good deal, that SmithBarney should—Lucas: No, no. I didn’t know that much. See, I hadn’t done a complete enough job inanalyzing energy. Back then we had lots of oil, so it wasn’t in the demand as itis today. So I hadn’t done my homework.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That was a lesson, wasn’t it?Lucas: Right. It wasn’t a failure, because I was helping a client. But we shouldn’thave gone there in the first place. We’re talking to Standard Oil of Colombia.Their lawyer was our counsel in Bogotá. We touched oil there but that’s all.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It was early. You’re faulting yourself for not picking up on that, but couldanybody have picked it up?Lucas: Oh yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So it was a matter of doing your homework?Lucas: What’s the economics—and there we go back to economics. Because it wason the coast, but it’s now where they take off to take the drugs out of thecountry. It’s near Barranquilla. But the infrastructure was going to be veryexpensive. It’s easier to transport oil than it is coal.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You didn’t pick up on any of that?Lucas: Not at the time.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, you were a young guy. You had something to learn. Lucas: A lot! But I was working for the firm, and the firm wanted me to do this, andI said, “Super!” And I ended up at Christmas in my home, see my folks, a freetrip.But then what really got me going was the Control Data Corporation. Andhere was this guy had worked for the Navy and secret aspects of thegovernment to develop new computers. So I thought this was a hot deal, andof course it turned out to be a very hot deal. And I bought 1,000 shares. Andit went up, a lot of money, so—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Where was the computer industry at that stage? Are we talking about latefifties?Lucas: Late-fifties, yes. Well, IBM existed then—to show you how far back they go.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Had you been following the development?Lucas: No.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How did you know that computers were a good thing, then?Lucas: Computers, by definition, they had a good market, and IBM sold at astratospheric price even then. So this was a new computer, and it worked forthe government. This was good.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: These are huge, massive computers, aren’t they?Lucas: Not that massive, but expensive. But there’s room for both.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So who was buying them?Lucas: The U. S. government.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And that was enough market?Lucas: That was enough. And this fellow—he had led the development. It’s a simplestory. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And it wasn’t Silicon Valley.Lucas: And it was not Silicon Valley.Lucas: And then National Semiconductor— There were eight engineers, and they hadleft Sperry Semiconductor en masse. So Smith Barney said, “No, we won’t doit.” So I said, “Fine. I’ll raise the money myself.” So I went to my friends—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Wow. But you were still employed at Smith Barney?Lucas: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And it was okay for you just to go out and do your own thing?Lucas: As long as there was no conflict of interest. Well, I just went ahead and did it.And I asked all the people in the department whether they wanted to invest—Iwasn’t doing anything illegal!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, but I can imagine a firm not being too happy about an employee goingout and—Lucas: Well, you’ll see—you’re kind of right, unfortunately. One of my roommates here at Stanford Business School was Bill Witter, DeanWitter’s son. And we were also in the fraternity; we became good friends, andall. A great guy, unfortunately he recently died. And he was working at theDean Witter office uptown. Of course, he lived in a different place than I did[chuckling]. He went in a limousine to work and all that. I liked going to hisclub every so often. And so he put in some money; he was the biggestinvestor. And then I just happened to meet some people. My parents and I justgot it together and got it going with the fellow from Minneapolis. So then I goin to my boss Nelson Schaenen and say, “I’d like to go on the board ofdirectors.” “Well, we’ll have to consider that.” And then they came back andsaid, “You can’t do it.” And you might have picked up on my personality thatthat wouldn’t have been very well received. [chuckling] And I said, “Why?”He said, “Well, it could hurt our reputation.” I said, “Come on, I’m a clerkaround here! I just do numbers, right? How can that hurt your reputation?” Idid well at biz school [but] we hadn’t learned how to be a director. No courseson directors, and I’m not sure there is one even to this day! And it’s somethingI’ve spent a lot of time on subsequently—being director, chairman of theboard, et cetera. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And no education, no classes.Lucas: No specific area—yes. So I didn’t know what I was talking about, but Iwanted to be a director. And he said [I] couldn’t. So I said, “Fine, Mr.Schaenen—I quit.” And he said “Don, you don’t want to do that. You’redoing great here, and you’ve got a great future.” And I said—[chuckling] I’membarrassed about it—“I want to be a director.” “Can’t do it.” I said, “Bye.”And so I went home for Christmas and all that sort of thing.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You’re not married yet.Lucas: No, I’m not married, and I don’t have any money. It would have been a veryunhappy wife if I had been married. I’ve got no responsibilities.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I know, but I’m also thinking that you were doing this without havinganything in the bank.Lucas: I never even thought about that; didn’t give it a second thought.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why?Lucas: Hubris. I was going to win! [laughter] I’ve got to be honest! I probably didn’thave time to think about it. I’m not a contemplative type, as you’ve probablygathered. One of our investors—this is the Good Lord taking over—one ofour investors was going through Idlewild Airport at the time, now John F.Kennedy. So I saw him and he said, “You should look into this firm. There’s anew firm being formed.” This is the last part of 1959-60, right in there. “Youshould really look into it because they’re making these types of investments.”There was no name for the company, but they financed small companies. Isaid, “Thanks a million.” And so one of the fellows that I had trained with atSmith Barney was Bob Schumm’s son, Jack. Bob Schumm was RowanGaither’s investment advisor.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh okay. We’re getting somewhere, aren’t we?Lucas: The plot thickens! The plot thickens! [laughter] So I decided to come here toPalo Alto to be interviewed, and so I arranged to be interviewed by Draper,Gaither & Anderson, with Mr. Gaither’s help. They said they were looking forfive guys. And I said, “One out of five—I should be able to make that!” <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Draper, Gaither & Anderson was founded maybe 1958?Lucas: No, they really started in ’60.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So you’re getting in at the very beginning, aren’t you?Lucas: Oh sure, oh sure. So I go to my boss, Nelson—Mr. Schaenen. “Mr. Schaenen,I want to go and be interviewed by DG&A.” And he said, “I won’t tell thepartners because it’ll ruin your career here.” Really, I am still touched by that.So I go to Palo Alto. I really don’t remember being in Palo Alto other than thePalo Alto Creamery. But they had their office at 145 Addison, and I was goingfor one for five. Well, it turns out they’d already hired four—Bill Draper, BillSymonds, who was the accountant, Tom Carey, and Crawford Cooley. Thefifth was me.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And you don’t have any connections.Lucas: Of course not. Who cares about connections; we just create connections. ButI’m smart and I can do the job.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That’s what you told them.Lucas: Absolutely. And I got sent up to Rowan Gaither.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Give us a little background on Rowan Gaither. Who is he and what is hisbackground?Lucas: Well, Rowan was fabulous. He had brain cancer, and they hoped that he hadgotten well. And he had accomplished a great deal. At one time he had beenhead of the MIT Rad Lab during World War II; head of the Ford Foundation;He started Rand Corporation and Mitre Corporation in Boston. And a verythoughtful person, a wonderful person. His son Jimmy [James C.]subsequently went to Stanford, and he was chairman of the board of trustees atStanford for a number of years, and head of the Cooley Law Firm, so you seehe took after his father.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: There was some substance there. Lucas: They were a great family. And I’d come from back East, and so it was decidedthat I would work for Rowan because he spent a great deal of time there.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why did they hire you?Lucas: Because I’m so good!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Come on, why did they?Lucas: I don’t know! [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You never found out?Lucas: No. I was the only one trained in finance. The only one in the firm. Only one!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: All right. So they knew that.Lucas: They did know that.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did they check your record?Lucas: I don’t know. I don’t know. But I wouldn’t tell lies.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I’m just wondering how spur of the moment this decision was.Lucas: How spur of the moment? Oh, well, General Anderson, as you’ve probablyheard, was the youngest major general ever. And he’d headed the daylightbombing of Germany, and this man can make decisions quickly. He was like asecond father to me.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were you being interviewed by all three principals?Lucas: I don’t think I interviewed with General Draper. I don’t remember that, but Idid with Larry who was more General Anderson’s go-to guy, and then Rowan.And I was supposed to work for Rowan, and we really got along. He’s verysmart. It was sad that he had to go back in the hospital, for his cancer. I usedto visit him in the hospital and all that. This is kind of defining for me. I had done a few deals in addition to National and the experiences in New England,Boston. It was okay; they didn’t quite have it, if you follow me. The talentpool wasn’t that big. It was very interesting.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You mean the opportunities to invest weren’t there?Lucas: Well, we invested in a few of them. But let’s go back to National. Sperry hadsued National Semiconductor. During the trial one of the engineers was beingquestioned about how the junction transistor was made. And they asked,“Why do you put this blue stuff on there?” “Oh, we put on the blue goop;that’s what we did over at Sperry.” And the lawsuit was over. The companywas padlocked. They just shut us down in Danbury, shut the company down.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Really! Because you’d stolen it?Lucas: Yes, we were guilty! The guys admitted they used their technology—bluegoop!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And that was enough? [chuckling]Lucas: Oh yes, that’s way too much.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But how could it not have come out, because presumably he was under oath.Lucas: Well, you don’t have to tell the truth. [chuckling] People do lie! Or they say,“I forget.”<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So that was the end of that deal.Lucas: First chapter. It’s the next chapter. So another one of my fraternity brotherswas Don [Donald E.] Weeden, Weeden & Company. He was back in NewYork, and they were investors in National Semiconductor. And they put up theget out of jail money—the bail. I’ll never forget going into Sperry Rand withthis top executive looking down at these little dumb Stanford kids, and theyweren’t going to give an inch. Anyway, we gave them their quarter of amillion and they went away, and we continued in business. Bernie Rothlein, the president through this, was asked to leave, and JackHagerty was made president. Jack had a sales background at TexasInstruments. He was not the long-term president. So later on, I had been introduced to Charlie [Charles E.] Sporck, who ran operations for Fairchild.Charlie is a real leader, very strong. There were six or seven of these fellows,and they were all willing to come with him. So I flew back to New York andtalked to the other investors. “Listen, this is the real deal. We’ve got to hireCharlie and the team.” People in New York didn’t believe me. And I said,“Oh.” So he said, “Come back to California and we’ll talk to Charlie and theteam.” So we met, and after a limited conversation in Palo Alto, everyoneagreed that these guys were it. So we hired all of them and they took over. Sothus I was introduced to Silicon Valley.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That’s quite a dramatic entrance.Lucas: And it was very stressful!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How old were you at this point?Lucas: I was thirty-two, thirty-three at this point, and quite exciting because after thenew management was public the stock went through the roof. As they say,“That was all she wrote.”I wanted to get to Silicon Valley and move from back East. I’ll tie thistogether for you—the contrast between what I had personally experienced inBoston and what I experienced here. The East generally was a closed society.What was important is where your family came from and the past. Out here,we were just interested in doing a good job, and not all this family and oldmoney stuff. Instead we would just get the job done. And so that was a prettydefining moment for me.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, it was open out here. You didn’t have to go along—Lucas: Meritorious. The best person wins sort of thing.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And you liked that! [chuckling]Lucas: I liked that.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So you picked up lock, stock, and barrel?Lucas: Well, we moved the headquarters here. 20<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Give me a synopsis of what Silicon Valley was like. We’re talking about1960?Lucas: It was cherry trees.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And apricots, right?Lucas: Yes. It was beautiful. I used to take a girlfriend down there and look at theorchids. The valley was really pretty. No 280, it was a beautiful place. This isa special place. And I even include Berkeley.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] Well, that’s a different part of the world.Lucas: It’s San Francisco. But really the action’s here. The action’s here.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, what was the action in terms of actual industry? Who was around in1960?Lucas: [with emphasis] HP.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Hewlett-Packard.Lucas: And I was very fortunate in that regard as well. Draper, Gaither & Andersonwanted me to join the Menlo Country Club. It cost all of $1,000, plus orminus.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now why did you do that?Lucas: Because they told me to. The partners. It’s the thing to do. I don’t rememberseeing David Packard there, but the rest of the executive members were there:Bill Hewlett, Noel Porter, Noel Eldridge, Frank Cavier and the rest of his topmanagement. And they invested with us a couple of times. We used to do adeal configuration where we guaranteed a bank loan and then bought commonstock at $1.00, maybe in a five-to-one ratio. There’s lots of leverage; thereweren’t very many shares so that means that if it goes good it goes up a lot, ifit goes bad you lose all.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see. Because the investor pool is so small. Lucas: No, because the number of shares— Like if you raise $500,000 and sell adollar a share, it’s 500,000 shares. If you have a $400,000 bank loan and thenyou raise $100,000, you only have 100,000 shares plus management shares, afewer number of shares. Dave and Bill would guarantee their loan for all theiremployees, and the VP’s could buy the common stock. We did everything onthe same terms. So that’s how they took care of their people. Help out theirVP’s. They were real leaders, fabulous leaders, team builders.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, but they’re taking care of their own, too, in a way.Lucas: That’s what I’m saying! Absolutely! And they’re making money and gettingexposure—everything good. Or if they lose, they learn how not to do that.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you get to know them?Lucas: Not that well, not Bill and Dave, but the other fellows. The CFO and thetreasurer and some of the other guys. But they were great guys, really great,and I used to see them at the club.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were you learning from them too?Lucas: Oh yes!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was all the conversation about business deals?Lucas: No. We didn’t talk that much about business. But I learned by example. Thiswas teamwork of the highest order when I’m taking my money and effectivelygiving the stock action to my employees. And you can see, that stuck in mymind.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And how new was that to give stock—Lucas: I don’t think many other people did it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And was it up and down the line? All employees? Lucas: Oh no, no. Just the executives. Because there’s not enough for all theemployees. So we did get to know them, got a chance to chat with them, andthese guys were obviously very good, very good.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And are you using the Country Club, in a sense? It’s becoming a socialnetwork for you, I’m imagining.Lucas: Not very much.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, why were you doing it?Lucas: It was a contributing factor.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were you enjoying it?Lucas: I enjoyed the interplay with the fellows. We’d go to the men’s grill and talkwith them and all that stuff. The real moral of the story is these wereimportant men but they had big hearts. Managers were sharing with theirteam. I’ve never forgotten it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It’s still March 10, 2009. I’m still talking very happily with Mr. Lucas, andit’s tape two. I think the time is to mention a wife that comes into your storyabout this time.Lucas: Not too long after I joined the firm, I also had joined this local club inAtherton which is called the Circus Club. And it’s the folks in San Franciscowho would come down here for the summer. They wanted some place to play,so this has a big field for the horses and tennis and swimming, so they couldget together. And you know, a long time ago people didn’t have their ownswimming pools—so they’d have some place to swim and et cetera, gettogether. That’s the Circus Club. So I’d go to a couple of things. But this wason New Year’s Eve, and so I saw this beautiful Latin girl, Lygia SotoHarrison. She had gone to school with my date at Sacred Heart in SanFrancisco!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] With your date!Lucas: Yes! And so they were good friends, and she introduced me, and so I saidmentally, “Bye, bye!” [to my date]. Lygia was Miss Central America, and sothat night I asked her whether she would consider marrying me. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That night!Lucas: I did not waste time. I did not waste time. That’s a true story. And people havekidded me about it ever since.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, where was your date?Lucas: Well, she was still over there. [chuckling] True. I can’t deny it. She wassweet, and then I was proposing. “Hey, listen, this is midnight, let’s go to LasVegas and have a party!” So that didn’t go very far. So anyway we all wenthome. In any case I still had some work to do.Lucas: Right, right. And so—I got a lawyer at the law firm, a young fellow, toarrange a date. That’s how bashful I am. We got married five months later.We had three children Nancy, Alexandra, and Donald. The two girls had beenadopted. So we bought a home in Atherton. In fact, we bought on Selby Lane,and then we moved next to Sacred Heart. We just a couple of years agofinished a house one block down from the original house we had bought—soback to Selby Lane. [My wife] put up with a lot because I worked pretty hardand I traveled a lot.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Had you explained that to her?Lucas: I think she had already figured that out. But she found out the details reallyquickly as soon as she got married, because I had to make money and takecare of the little babies, all that stuff.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But had she been planning to settle in this country?Lucas: Her father had been assigned to the United Nations for Costa Rica. Her familyis an old family from Costa Rica and earlier from Spain, and so that’s how shegot to San Francisco. She had gone to school there and then came backbecause her first husband had died, not too long after getting married,unfortunately for them. It didn’t take me long to propose, et cetera, et cetera.Oh, and I used to go down to Palm Springs, so I brought her down to PalmSprings. Of course my parents had to meet her and that was really tricky.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why? Lucas: Well, I’m the baby in the family, and so my mother, you know, she had tomeet her, and she was so nervous about—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You mean your wife-to-be was nervous.Lucas: Everybody was nervous. Because I was in a hurry, obviously!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I would say so! [chuckling] And did she pass muster?Lucas: Sure did, and took good care of my mom, Gogo. Back to business. The other thing that was very apparent to me after not toomuch time with the firm, there wasn’t a good understanding of finance by thepartners. Rowan Gaither had died maybe six months or something after Ijoined the firm. He was really smart, a genius—leader.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did he understand finance?Lucas: No, no, but he understands organizations, people. He was a people guy, and heput together some great organizations: Rand and Mitre, Ford Foundation, etcetera, the law firm. He was fabulous, so that was a huge loss. [pause] Youknow, it was clear that we were short, and that’s when I tried to get PeteBancroft to join us, and fortunately he did join us. About the same time,Crawford [Cooley] and I were made partners and Bill [Draper] was not. Sohis father and Bill left the firm. General Draper and his son left the business.General Draper was a very important person and knew a lot of people, etcetera. We didn’t fully realize, however, he didn’t fully understand venturecapital. And his son Bill—a very nice guy had a lovely wife, Phyllis—hadworked at a steel mill, so it wasn’t a good fit.Lucas: Pitch made the adjustment [from the steel mill] much more easily than Bill. Inmy opinion, Pitch really developed into quite an outstanding venturecapitalist.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But let’s say a little bit more about that because they came into what becameknown as venture capital by a very circuitous route. Draper, for example, wasa general.Lucas: Yes, but that’s not how he started. He had been head of Mexican Light andPower and a partner at Dillon and Read before that. Mr. Draper had become an “appointed general,” meaning that he didn’t have a long military education,background. All you’ve got to know about General Anderson—youngestmajor general ever; you know he’s a real hero. Daylight bombing ofGermany; you know he’s got what it takes. He was a great leader. He washonored, revered, and so he knew a number of the people in New York,important people like Jock Whitney, J.H. Whitney and Company, those kindof fellows. And I’ll never forget going to the 21 Club, and 21 Club people justloved him because they love airplanes, all that. I piggybacked on this and hadmany good times there. General Anderson was kind of like a second father to me. He had invested in acompany called Raychem, one penny/share to $150/share. Not many of thosedeals. And he couldn’t miss; he just did one good deal after another. Howevermuch money he wanted just flowed in from these East Coast people. So hewas the spiritual leader and the money raiser, and General Draper was theconservative experienced executive. They both got to know each other as ourrepresentatives at the start of NATO. And so it was a great opportunity to joina real moneymaker and leader.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why didn’t the business go well?Lucas: They weren’t real venture capitalists. DG&A had a significant apartmenthouse investment. General Anderson had made the deal. You know, whenyou get on a roll you think you can’t miss, and that’s when you miss. Andthen we bought some property around San Luis Obispo. Things we shouldn’thave done—it’s not venture capital. It just made no sense at all.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was that a function of having endless money?Lucas: No, no. We didn’t have endless. We started with $6 [million] and it wasincreased to 7.6 [million], so we didn’t have endless money. No. Too muchsuccess—too fast and too much.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I’m being presumptuous to question you, but are you perhaps coming from apresent-day perspective? That investment in those days had a much broaderscope, so that you were not necessarily thinking high-tech, high-risk,immediate return? These guys may have thought that investing in real estatewas a great idea.Lucas: [pause] But that’s not what our investors expected.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Really, so venture capital was defined. Lucas: Well, implicitly, not explicitly perhaps.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What did you understand it to be?Lucas: Small companies that are going to grow into big companies. That’s whatGeneral Anderson was successful at. He started Lear Siegler, RoyalIndustries, Raychem—he had a tremendous string of successes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Okay, so I’m wrong in my perception.Lucas: Well, I don’t want to say that, but— [chuckling]. Really, the message is don’tread your press clippings because then you’ll get a little infatuated withyourself. And the balance had gone away. Rowan had died; General Draperhad left. So I had to re-negotiate a loan at Bankers Trust for $1.5 millionwhich we couldn’t repay.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Ooh boy.Lucas: Ooh boy.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What are you thinking at that time?Lucas: What am I thinking? How not to tell my wife we’re moving out of Atherton.We can’t afford it. [chuckling] So General Anderson left the partnership.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because of that one bad deal?Lucas: No, no, no. We had several bad deals. See, he used to drill up all his incomeby drilling oil wells, and he didn’t find that much oil in Oklahoma. And I waspresident of the oil company. We developed a gas stripping plant inpartnership with Continental Oil. And they told us—I’ll never forget this—[there were] reserves of 110 billion cubic feet. And we only had 10. So thatcompany was broke. We had bank loans, etc.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was that deception?Lucas: Oh, no, no, no. I’m sorry, the people in Oklahoma said that—the experts, thegeologists. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, but—Lucas: We were deceived, yes, but not deception. They made a mistake; they made amistake. But then General Anderson went down there with his old friends andsaid, “There’s more gas near us, and we’ve got to go over and get it.” And hetalked the guys into doing that and resurrected that investment. Whew. Butthat was close, and then we were public and the stock goes down and all thatsort of thing. But then we had the loan at the bank, and so they left it to thekids.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: The new people.Lucas: Yes. I think Larry stayed on, Larry Duerig. I’m not sure about that, but it wasLarry and Crawford and me. Bill Symon wasn’t a partner—and Pete.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, you haven’t talked about Pete yet.Lucas: We’ll get there. But I’d like to keep the train of thought. It is important tounderstand what the general partners arrangement with the limited partnerwas. We believed we had a great deal. The economics were—we had a lowsalary, $25,000—but we had 40 percent of the profits!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That was an incentive, wasn’t it!Lucas: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: They were giving you a low salary to give you incentive.Lucas: Yes. Incentive. See, the generals didn’t need it. They had their other income.And for the youngsters—that was enough. A much different concept than intoday’s venture capital partnerships, which are typically around an early fee of2 percent of the capital and 20 percent of the profits. And frankly I think that’sa big mistake.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, expand on why that is.Lucas: Well, because, the more money you raise, the more money you make. So, let’sraise a lot of money. Not how can I employ that money wisely? Sometimesyes, sometimes no. There’s been a couple of firms that have done it, and they’re wonderful firms—KP [Kleiner Perkins], Sequoia, Mayfield andothers. Sutter Hill, the fellows across the street. There are a number of firmsthat have done well. But too much money is a common problem. Becauseinherently, these are smaller investment deals, and they are not infinitelyextrapolable. And so I think the VC business today is in some, if you will, disarray. Maybetoo many firms. There’s a finite number of new industries that you canparticipate in, right? They’re not infinite. And so perhaps we have too muchmoney chasing too few good deals.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, I’ve heard that before.Lucas: And too much interest income, the fee, the 2 percent.In other words, if I canraise a billion dollars, I get $20 million a year to spend. The partners keepmost of it and have some employees go out and do the work. Good deal! Butis it such a good deal for the investors? Perhaps not. So things were kind of tight. Around ’65 or so, Doug [Douglas C.] Leanderfrom the Bankers Trust was coming here from Phoenix to call their note, callthe bank note. Now that’s serious—then you go broke, right? And I kid withpeople and I say, “I play tough. His plane crashed. And he never made it.” Itdid, unfortunately, I’m sorry. And so it gave us some time, and we worked ourway out of that. But that was how close, that was really close. That was howclose. It was tough.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Terribly unfortunate for him and his family, but there you are on your specialstar.Lucas: Well, and my fingernails gone away. That was tight, but we worked our waythrough, and then some investments matured and did well.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you tell your wife any of these scary stories? Did she have any clue?Lucas: Well, she wasn’t that interested in business. She thinks about her children andjust spends money, like any good woman, you know. I would have the guysover, and so she generally knew what was going on.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: When things are going wrong, as in that incident, are you worried a lot? Whatare you doing when things go wrong?Lucas: Work harder. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes? How would working harder solve that problem?Lucas: Well, figure out where we could sell a company, or how to make more money,how to redeploy assets. This is where Pete just did a brilliant job. He tookcharge of a number of investments in our companies and ended up sellingthem at good prices. He really did a superb job. A superb job.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How did he come to be there?Lucas: Didn’t I say that?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh that’s right. You did say that.Lucas: We needed talent, and I introduced him, and they agreed, and we brought himin.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How did you know him?Lucas: From Wall Street. We knew each other back there.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And you were impressed?Lucas: I was. Pete has a number of things that I don’t have. He’s very sophisticatedand articulate, and he’s much more polite than I am—a number of things. Hecame from money, and I’m a farmer, and so he gets along with these peoplemuch better than I do. Really.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Has that held you back ever?Lucas: I don’t think so. He became president of Bessemer. He’s got a wonderful waywith people.But we’re different personalities as you can tell. So I think together we madeone hell of a team. See Crawford ran the books, ran the office, took care of thesecretaries and the back office. And that’s why I wanted him to be here [at theinterview] because he could correct some of the things and make it moreaccurate. He’s older, and he had that law firm sort of background. It was ateam effort. 30<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How would you categorize what you were doing? What was your job?Lucas: Make money.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Does that mean also spotting the deals?Lucas: Yes, recruiting, trying to make deals. I’m pretty creative on deal structure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, explain what creativity means in this context.Lucas: You know, how you structure the ownership of a company. I just had moreexperience than they had in that sort of thing because I’d been doing it for awhile, you remember. .<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So we’re now in mid to late—Lucas: ’65.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And you’ve been doing this risk investment since fifty—Lucas: Well, ’57 or so. This was jumping in the fire. Things got hot real quick.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: All this new blood that’s coming into the firm, are they working as hard asyou are?Lucas: No, but there wasn’t much new blood. The only new blood was really Pete.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That’s true.Lucas: Pete did a fine job selling some companies; he just did a superb job of it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did his social skills coming into it?Lucas: Absolutely. He got along with the investment bankers, and he just did awonderful job for us. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So he was a wonderful addition.Lucas: Oh! Fabulous! But I was a little upset with him when we both went toOklahoma when we were told that we only had a small fraction of the naturalgas we thought we had. He said I was a loser, and I didn’t like that, because itwasn’t my deal. It was General Anderson’s deal, and I didn’t know anythingabout oil.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And he called you a loser?Lucas: Yes!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Or he called the deal—Lucas: No, he called me, personally, and that hurt my feelings, so I had to prove hewas wrong. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It was just more incentive, wasn’t it? [chuckling]Lucas: Yes, and so I did! And so we ended up making good money. We worked ongetting an adjacent gas field connected to us, so we worked through that, butthat was tough. And that’s—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were you behind it, once the decision was made to go after the gas?Lucas: Well, there was no choice. We had a plant with no gas.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So the decision had been made.Lucas: No, not a decision. We had to sell them [on the idea] to let us process theirgas. Continental Oil had this field. I don’t know whether it was Continental, tobe honest. I’ve honestly forgotten, but there was this adjacent gas field thatGeneral Anderson knew the big wheels in it, and he was successful. We werejust dying, and we put a pipeline in there and everything was fine.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I’m sorry. I got the deals mixed up. I was thinking about the one where the oildidn’t work out. Lucas: That’s the one! You’re right, absolutely right. We ran out of gas. There wassupposed to be 110 [billion cubic feet]; there was only 10. So we’d beenmisled by the geologists. But we went to an adjacent pool where they wereflaring the gas, and so we put a pipeline over there connected to our plant.Everything ends up happily ever after—after some heart attacks.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: If things were going well, what was the reason behind the demise of thepartnership in 1966? Right?Lucas: Eventually, 1967. We liquidated the partnership and we made good money. Itwas terminated in 1966.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And why the termination?Lucas: Because we made a good deal of money. And so we ended up going to anoffice down here in Palo Alto on Stanford property. I continued doing thesame thing which I do today. I’ve just continued on. And people all did theirown individual thing. I obviously like this business.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Maybe it’s because I don’t understand how these things go, but if you’remaking good money why are you stopping?Lucas: We got other people’s money.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh! You’ve used up the fund.Lucas: The fund’s fully invested, and we have other people’s money.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see. And you spent it allLucas: We invested it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] Okay.Lucas: And we can’t get our share out until liquidation. The limited partners(including the general partners, limited partner and investor) received theirshare of the capital invested plus 60 percent, and we received out share of the40 percent of the profits. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It was the terms of the deal.Lucas: Yes, the structure of the partnership. In all candor, I think that we had gonethrough a very difficult time, and we’d just as soon go our separate ways, sortof. Now, we weren’t mad at each other or anything like that. None of that, butit was stressful. And we had made a fair amount of money, so let’s go do whatwe each want to do. Pete went back to New York, and General Anderson,Larry, Crawford, and I continued the office together.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Everybody had more or less come to an agreement that it was time to moveon?Lucas: Oh, we all agreed, of course. We were at the finish line and we were tired. Itwas just natural. It was the terms of the deal. The original term was fiveyears—way too short. So we extended it two years, and that was adequate, butwe had to hustle. And thus Pete selling these companies became even moreimportant. That’s how we gained liquidity.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But this system that is so common now, where you raise a fund, and it has atleast a tentative expiration date, right? Either the company is sold or acquiredor something.Lucas: Interest in the companies.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: The companies, yes, because it’s a big fund. Was that something that Draper,Gaither & Anderson had dreamed up? To invest in that manner? Or had youbeen doing it that way before?Lucas: No, and this is new! No one had done it this way. Let’s start over again. Noone had done this before. What had been done before—we touched on it—theRockefellers. They used their own money, put their own money up, makesome investment, and as it turned out they did very well. So the expiration isincidental. It’s their money.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I understand that.Lucas: But now we have OPM—“other people’s money.” And they’d like to see theirmoney back, too. And the general partners would like to put our hands on ourprofits. But I think the key thing that may be missed is the five-year [term]was not wise. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, it was too short.Lucas: Too short, so we forced liquidity on these investments, so we added two yearsto it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What I’m trying to drive home— What I’m trying to get you to say [Lucaschuckles] is that this was really novel.Lucas: What was novel?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Having this—Lucas: A limited partnership.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes!Lucas: Well, it was the first one, yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But you didn’t say that, you see.Lucas: Oh, well—okay. [laughter] Well, why didn’t you say it? Sure, it was the firstone. It was done before us—we had nothing to do with it. We’re youngsters.This was done probably by Rowan and Ed Huddleson at the Cooley law firm.That’s probably where it originated.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And was it just a logical thing to invent this new mechanism for makingmoney?Lucas: Yes, yes, yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And it didn’t have any direct precedents.Lucas: I don’t want to say that; I’m not sure. See, the whole idea of a partnership is totake people with money, and let the managers invest it. So there’s nothingnew about that. But it was what we did with the money, i.e., invest in smallcompanies. There was one firm, AR&D in Boston, American Research andDevelopment. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, [Georges] Doriot.Lucas: Doriot. We both were at the very beginning. And fortunately we’d come backfrom a difficult position. And so we wanted to take our hard-earned profitsand put it in our own accounts. And so that’s what we did and very happily.Subsequently I’ve done this with my own money, and I’ve had unlimitedpeople and firms invest with us. You can see that that left a blot on my mind,that working in a partnership is tough.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] All right. Why don’t we pick up that theme next time. Thank you.Lucas: Sure, sure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Today is March 24, 2009. It is our second interview with Mr. Donald L.Lucas. I want to start where we left off, which was your years at Draper—Lucas: Draper, Gaither, Anderson—DG&A.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, exactly. I was going to pick up at the point of your decision to terminatethe partnership. I assume that you were making some choices about how youwanted to work from then on. You’d been working as a group, and as we bothknow, ever since you have been working as a freelancer.Lucas: You’re setting me up. Is that what this is called? [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I’m setting you up!Lucas: I want to clarify. I try to be accurate. I didn’t leave. We liquidated the firm. Itwas terminated, and so we were all free to do what we want. There were noentangling alliances, et cetera. However, a number of us, General Anderson,Larry Duerig, Crawford Cooley, and I all went to another office on Sand HillRoad. Well, prior to that on Welch Road, but then we moved to Sand Hill. Ithink we lost a couple—General Anderson at that time and Larry. Maybe itwas just Crawford and myself [who went to Sand Hill].  But to your question: it was difficult for me because [pause] investing tends tobe more of a personal thing for me, and particularly when it comes to thecompanies. I believe that by spending time with the companies and helpingthem, you can increase the chances of greater success. Other people havedifferent views. So that’s a different style. The firms today—these big multibillion dollar venture capital firms—they’re more investors as opposed to, say,partners or whatever word you want to use.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see. You put your money in and you want it out, but with a greaterdetachment from the company itself?Lucas: Well, I would put it the other way around. I get to know the executives, andthen I want to help them and help them grow, and of course, help us, help themoney investors in the process. But it’s more hands on—that’s the point.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is that an older style of venture capital? Most of the people I’ve talked with sofar seem to have a similar philosophy. It’s not to them just you put yourmoney in and you walk away—it’s a very personal engagement with thecompany.Lucas: You’re saying the people you have talked with are older people. I think it’smore a question of volume, i.e., how much money do they have. Rememberthe two and twenty—2 percent of the money is paid yearly? So they have bigsalaries and they get 20 percent of the profits. So it’s a pretty good deal, as Ithink I intimated the last time we talked. I think that that probably will bereduced to some degree, because it’s maybe too good a deal. But in any case, Ilike to put up my own money and my friends’ money, and we all share thegains, if any.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh is that really the way you do it?Lucas: Yes, and then I ask them for help, and we have fun, and we’ve beensuccessful. So it works for me, and it’s very satisfying to help the group go onto great success.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: In terms of the people that you invest with, do you chose investors accordingto the talents they have that they can then apply?Lucas: Not necessarily, they’re friends. Catch as catch can. Crawford Cooley investswith me to this day, and his son’s now also investing with me. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see.Lucas: I really enjoy spending time with the executives and helping them. SometimesI have to fire them. But accomplishing things that haven’t been doneheretofore is super.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So you like the hands-on.Lucas: I do! Oh yes, and I’m somewhat guilty. Guilty. Money is not the sole reason.It’s an important factor, but it’s not the only driving force. The driving force issuccess. One way to accomplish that is focus.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I know you’re telling me that that’s your motivation. But also, I would thinkthat you have a certain responsibility to your investors, even though they maybe friends. At least indirectly money has to be part of it, because they are notgoing to be too interested in continuing to invest through Don Lucas if—Lucas: If we lose, if we lose.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And you don’t want to lose either.Lucas: Of course not, no. No, I’m not a good loser. But in addition—I can’t think ofan exception—there are other people in professional venture capital firms thatare in these companies as well. So it’s just not me and my friends. When yougo on the board of a company, your obligations are to society, the otherinvestors, and also the officers and the employees. So you have multipleparties that you’re responsible to.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is becoming a board member always a condition of your investment?Lucas: Unless one of my friends is on the board. Well, that’s the way it’s worked. Ihaven’t thought of it in those terms. But yes, because I think I can add value.At least I think so. See, that’s the operative part.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Please give me a picture of the sorts of things that you might do as a boarddirector. Is there any kind of generic statement you can make? Or would yourather say, well, in the case of whatever, this is how I handled this particulardirectorship. Lucas: I think there’s two ways to answer it. One is, as one with my background, Iobviously like numbers. And so in all cases, I have [to be] deeply involvedwith the numbers, and a lot of people aren’t particularly interested. So that’sfine, because typically I’ll work with the CFO or the chief accounting officer,or whatever the case may be. There’s lots of information in the numbers, andto pull that information out is important. And I do that even for verysubstantial companies.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because of your reputation in the field, do people look to you with theexpectation that that particular function is going to be yours? Looking at thenumbers and seeing if they add up?Lucas: Probably. If you’ve read the literature, a lot of committees have become moreimportant, you know, Sarbanes-Oxley and all. And I happen to be not asvociferously opposed to SOX as many people are because I do feel that wehave not properly accounted for the results. And so we collectively have anobligation to society. We had the accounting scandals re pricing of stockoptions, etc.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Right, I remember.Lucas: And so we’re guilty. Collectively, we haven’t done a good job. So that [SOX]was imposed by the government. I don’t think that we were doing as good of ajob as we should have. Anyway, that’s just a fundamental, but there are manyother aspects. But the key thing that I focus on is the people. I told you before,I was a coach in some sports, and I’m older, obviously, and I have seen a lot.So often times I can help the team. So I try to help them where there may bedeficiencies in management—to help them bring that type of know-how to thecompany. Build a top team.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you have a network, probably regional, so that if they need bankingexpertise or whatever it might be, you would know exactly whom to contact?Lucas: I can’t say that specifically, no. It would be send the word out and send the netout and try to get the best we can. But no, I don’t have anything specific, andthat would not be right because I don’t want anyone to think I’m placing myfriends in their company. It’s their company; it’s not my company; it’s theircompany. But I’d like to help them.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I can see there that your long experience would be very valuable. Lucas: But there are prerogatives—you know, the CEO is the boss! And so I try tohave a light touch. I’m not light by nature, but I try to be as light as I can,because I have no agenda other than for success. I do have one agenda whichis not to fail.That you are working, I guess, in every case with other venturecapitalists or whomever.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You have your style of doing venture investment, which I’m assuming is quitedifferent than the way many new firms—Lucas: Somewhat.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: —are doing it nowadays. And does that create a certain tension when you’retrying to work together on an enterprise?Lucas: Well, I would kind of put it the other way. If we have joined together, theypretty well know what they’re going to get from me. It’s been a process ofselection, adverse selection. They probably wouldn’t have participated,because they know what they’re going to get with me. I’m an open book.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] And you’re not going to budge either!Lucas: Well, I’m going to continue to try to do my best. That’s not to say I’m notgoing to budge. I’ve been wrong too many times, unfortunately.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I do want to talk about some failures.Lucas: No, I don’t want to talk about those. But one thing I do—you touched on it—is very interesting. I used to invest, as I told you previously, in New Englandbecause there’s that center up in Boston, and then I’ve been a very activechairman of the board in a company, HBO, in Atlanta, but I really have prettymuch, restricted myself to California.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But I saw some foreign companies on your bio.Lucas: Oh, I have two Chinese companies. I’m really slowly withdrawing from thosebecause I can’t be as active as I want to be. And I can’t do as good a job as I’dlike to do because there are certain local customs that I obviously have noknowledge of. 40<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why did you get involved in the first place?Lucas: Well, they asked me to, and I thought I could help them. I keep learning, evenat this advanced age, that the closer geographically suits my temperamentbetter. And I think I can call on—what you were alluding to—the network. Ihave a better network here; I don’t have any kind of a network in China.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Geographic proximity seems a sine qua non for somebody like you who wantsa hands-on style of dealing with a company—unless you’re willing to be onan airplane most of your life.Lucas: Or to be somewhat arrogant, and I am losing that. After some mistakes youlose that; you don’t quite have the same arrogance.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you consider that you were arrogant at certain stages of your life?Lucas: Oh I’m certainly— Some people probably think I’m arrogant now. There’s adifference between being right and being arrogant, and I probably wasoverarching or whatever you want to call it, pushy, whatever.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Would another word be overconfident?Lucas: Of course. All those words! [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, let’s pick up the chronological thread, if you think that’s the way to go.You’re now out of Draper—Lucas: Gaither & Anderson.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You end up with Crawford [Cooley] in an office on Sand Hill Road, and thenwhat?Lucas: We had some continuing associations. For example, DG&A had sold Tracor,in Austin, Texas, a number of companies—I believe three. So I was on theboard down there, and I was Don Lucas from California. You know theTexans, you know the Texans—these are real Texans, but I love them. Thecompany was around $20 million-$30 million in revenues. We ended up around $1.5 billion. And it was just a marvelous experience. There were anumber of people involved who were very talented in finance, so I learnedfrom them—a CPA and a lawyer and an investment banker. So that was agreat experience for me, so I continued on that board of directors for a longtime.And there are some other ongoing relationships. We made some additionalinvestments as we went along. We moved up to 3000 Sand Hill Rd., MenloPark, when this building was built. I participated with the developer of thiscomplex. I’ve been here, of course, ever since. And then B.J. Cassin came in.And so he and Crawford moved here.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you consider these people partners?Lucas: They were not partners.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What were they?Lucas: Real good friends.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And that remains so.Lucas: Yes, to this day.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So it’s always been Don Lucas.Lucas: Well, no, it’s not Don Lucas. It’s us.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But it’s very different than the way I understand most venture capital firms.Lucas: Yes, we’re not a firm. We’re individuals.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see that. And that’s why you’re called iconoclastic.Lucas: Well, I don’t know what that word means. It’s too complicated for me.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] It seems to me that you’re a flashback to the older style—well,that’s not even true, either. Lucas: No, I don’t think there was an older style. There was no older style.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I was thinking of the Rockefellers, et cetera. But on the other hand, theyhad no contact with the companies they were investing in, so that’s not amodel.Lucas: No. I set off by myself because—and maybe I didn’t fully answer that firstquestion. [pause] If you help out, you should make money. But everybodyfeels that way about themselves, so there’s some tension. So I just don’t haveany tension.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You didn’t want the tension.Lucas: I didn’t want any tension. And it’s not arrogance!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I have to take from that—and you correct me if I’m wrong—that there hadbeen some tension.Lucas: Oh sure, sure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You get a bunch of power-wielding men, and it seems to me that—Lucas: If you get a bunch of men they’re going to argue; they’re going to fight.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] And particularly over money.Lucas: Particularly over money.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Money or women.Lucas: Oh, we didn’t have any women problems to my knowledge.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] I didn’t mean in that particular case.Lucas: We did have disagreements just like anybody, but it wasn’t— Well, it waswhatever it was. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Say something, please, about what goes through your mind when you firstlearn of a new opportunity. Maybe my question is, how do you learn ofthings?Lucas: Okay. Because founders look for people with money, that’s real easy. That’swhy they come.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So they come to you.Lucas: But some people just want money and nothing else, and we don’t want to dothat, so they’re disqualified. But I can just go over one, and this is not atypical, but it’s a little bit at theextreme. So I’m sitting in the conference room here, and I get a call from agood friend of mine who is the chief economist at J.P. Morgan, John Lipsky,and now he’s the number two guy at the IMF [International Monetary Fund].He’s an economist, and I was chairman of, as I told you, the Stanford Institutefor Economic Policy Research, SIEPR. He was on the board of SIEPR, andwe got to know each other. I’m a great admirer of his, and he’s a really smartPhD economist and all that. My assistant said I had a call from Beijing. “Of course I’ll take the call.” Hesaid, “You’ve got to meet this young lady [Elizabeth Holmes]!” I said, “John,what?” “You’ve got to meet her; she’s fabulous.” “Okay.” I’m figuring twentyminutes, right? This young lady comes in; I think she probably was twentyone years old at the time and had left Stanford, didn’t graduate, and she had acompany called Theran. And I thought this was going to be a shortconversation. Well, now I’m chairman of the board and spend a lot of timewith her and the company and she’s doing super! She had some other investors, but she was looking for help and money; maybemore money then help. But anyway, she got both whether she wanted it ornot! So she’s in the area of helping drug companies develop new drugs moreefficiently and has some really exciting technology. And so instead of twentyminutes, we spent two or three hours talking. So I got interested, raised somemoney, became chairman as I said, and we’re still at it. And the company’sgrowing quite rapidly and successfully. We’ve gone through the kind ofproblems you’d imagine.Lucas: She had no background in business, and so it’s quite presumptuous forsomebody to say, “I’m going to be president of the company.” But there’s animportant distinction. That’s what I felt when I [first] met her. After spendinga lot more time with her. I learned her great-grandfather was an entrepreneurand started Fleischmann’s – packaged yeast. It was very successful. So that was one side, that’s the entrepreneur side, but she was in the medical side. Ah!It turns out later, the hospital very near where they lived is named after hergreat uncle who was involved with medicine. So she came by both of the twotalents necessary here, one medicine and the other entrepreneurship, quitenaturally. You could just see it the way she handles things, the way she thinks.And so obviously I think she needed help. I think that’s a fairly typicalsituation.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, typical and not typical. I don’t imagine too many twenty-one-year-oldwomen are starting companies.Lucas: No, but the basic ingredients are there.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I can understand that. But say something about what she might have run upagainst just because of her age and maybe even her gender. Were there anyextra hurdles that she had to leap?Lucas: Oh, there are advantages. She was attractive, too. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I can imagine people saying what does this twenty-one-year old know aboutanything?Lucas: Well, she’s really smart. That’s very apparent. She’s really smart about thisbusiness.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But as you were implying, she didn’t know anything about running acompany.Lucas: I didn’t mean to say she didn’t know anything. I said she had a lot to learn.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I put it too extremely.Lucas: You know, it didn’t occur to me.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Does a woman entrepreneur in the world that you know have an equalopportunity to a man starting out in a business? Have you observed any—Lucas: Bias. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Any bias.Lucas: The answer is no, but that doesn’t prove much. We’ve had some strong femaleexecutives, like at Oracle we’ve got a co-president, Safra Katz, who is femaleobviously, and she’s fabulous. She used to work downstairs here for DrexelBurnham [Lambert]. Nothing stopped her, and she’s one of the top fifteen,ten, whatever, in America. So it’s not been my experience.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Good!Lucas: Well, I had a strong mom and I’m indebted to her. So maybe there’s a positivebias, not a negative bias! [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now, of all the people that she could have chosen to come to for money, whydid she choose you?Lucas: Well, I think she talked to John. I’ve never questioned it. You know, whenyou need money, you go most anyplace.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because you take a very hands-on approach, maybe John realized that shewould need your hands-on experience.Lucas: I think so, I think so. But I also made it very clear, that’s the way I operate.But I really have just noticed that there’s not a lot of top female executivesand CEOs.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why is that?Lucas: I don’t know.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What about women in venture capital?Lucas: There’s been a couple; not terribly successful as a whole.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is there anything to be said about a general kind of personality that goes alongwith venture capital?Lucas: Well, I would define it differently than maybe some of the people. See,they’re executives of the firms now. There’s a lot of money to invest, and they have to be executives. You’ve got a lot of people working for them, et cetera,et cetera. But see to me, venture capital is about helping the companiesprosper, and it’s not about the management side of the money, if you will. So Ireally look at it person-to-person as opposed to organization-to-organization. Idon’t know whether that explains it?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you feel that that’s not the way most venture capitalists go about it?Lucas: Yes. I’m going to get personally involved, and I think they’re more detached.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yet there are people that have a reputation for getting personally involved. Ithink of Tom Perkins, for example.Lucas: Well, Tom used to work for me in a company, and I know Tom pretty well.And I don’t think he’s an exception.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Really?Lucas: Yes. I’m a great admirer of Tom.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because he has a hands-on approach?Lucas: He founded a great firm, Kleiner Perkins, and Gene Kleiner and Tom—Gene’s dead and Tom’s gone on to other things. But they’ve done a wonderfuljob, it’s a great firm. It is probably the outstanding firm.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why?Lucas: I know several of the people there now, and it’s a fine firm, lots of money, lotsof success.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is that what you look at when you say it’s a successful firm? That it makesmoney?Lucas: No, no. That they have had successful companies from incubation to maturity.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see, going back to what you think is central. Lucas: And that’s success. If you’re good at building something that’s important andbig and profitable, then it’s going to have made you a lot of money. It’s theother way around; it’s not the money, it’s the end result.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, you’re being very consistent in your philosophy. [laughter]Lucas: I hope!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I know Tom Perkins came out of technology. He had been director of—whatwas it, the computer division?Lucas: At HP.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, at HP.Lucas: He’s smart, charming, an outstanding person.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What I was trying to get to is, you make it very clear that you come from afinancial standpoint.Lucas: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Not from a technological standpoint, and Tom does have the technicalbackground and management.Lucas: All.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh really?Lucas: Not necessarily finance. Most people think you can hire finance, right? Buthe’s got it all. He understood marketing, selling, technology, so he was wellrounded.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because of his other HP experiences.Lucas: And HP is one of the great companies. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, has [lack of a technical background] ever been a detriment for you? Thefact that you’re great on the numbers—Lucas: I think it’s been an asset. I don’t argue with them about technology.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Can you really judge a company in terms of just its people and its finances?Lucas: I go get the experts.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Okay. So it’s not as though you’re investing, having no idea about what thetechnology’s about.Lucas: No, no, no. I’ve got a lot of good friends, whether they come from Stanford orBerkeley, etc.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So is that what you do? Did you do that, for example, with the young woman?You talked to her, you were impressed, but then you picked up the phone?Lucas: Sure, sure. Well, we have the Lucas Imaging Center at Stanford. So I talked toGary [M.] Glazer who runs it. We probably have the number-one imagingcenter in the world! So I said, “Gary, what about this idea?” “Well—.” Andthen I’ve got some friends at Mayo; I helped Mayo sell their hotel chain. Theywere going to lose a lot of money. They ended up making a fair amount. Andso they have helped me. And so I reach out to other people. And so I considerthat an advantage, actually, because I don’t know.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, but you see how important the network is to you, and vice-versa.Lucas: Absolutely. And so I nurture that by inclusion—do you want to invest withus? Or maybe, like at Stanford, give them money, or whatever.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It sounds very satisfying. I like the idea that it’s about people.Lucas: It is. I do too. It makes it easy.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Should we talk about specific companies? How about picking out one? Lucas: I don’t know what you’re trying to get at.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I’m trying to get at—lessons is a heavy word—but principles thatillustrate how you go about it. What you’re thinking about in dealing withother people’s money and yours in an entrepreneurial situation—illustrationsof your philosophy.Lucas: Oracle would be the easiest, because it’s a big successful company andeveryone knows about it. How I got involved with Oracle early—they startedout downstairs in this building.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] That’s pretty convenient.Lucas: That’s very convenient.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Does that mean that you have an incubator?Lucas: No, no. They rented some space downstairs.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Okay. It’s as simple as that. I didn’t know them from Adam. So I have to goupstairs to my office, and so I’d see the lights on. I tend to work long hoursand come in at odd hours—they’re always there at night! So I went to theiroffice and asked, “What the heck do you guys do?” “Oh we make relationaldatabases.” And of course, that pffft—right over my head! I said, “Oh really!”And they had a very attractive graduate at Stanford, a gal who was thereceptionist, who Larry [Ellison] later married. And they were dressed likethey did in those days, hippies.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And when was this?Lucas: In ’78-’79, something like that. And so then they asked me, “Oh we’ve gotthis problem of evaluating the stock.” Larry barely knew what stock was. SoI helped him, and he said, “Well, what about being a director?” “Okay.”“Well, how about being the chairman?” I said, “Okay.” And that’s how itstarted. It was that simple. So they clearly were doing well. They were makingmoney from the start.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Just out of those offices down there? 50Lucas: Yes, and then, of course, they moved out soon—more space, et cetera. Andthey didn’t need any money; they needed business—somebody who knew alittle bit about business and about finance.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why didn’t they need money? They had venture capital backing?Lucas: They really didn’t need VC capital. They were profitable and generated theirown capital.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh I see!Lucas: They took this technology, this technology that was what IBM developeddown at Santa Teresa, and commercialized it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Had Ellison been at IBM?Lucas: No. He spotted a good idea and he commercialized it. That’s the end of thestory. But it is pretty unusual in that respect. The point is that they hadexcellent technology, and they hired great people, got them to focus onsuccess. And they were profitable and did all the right things. Oracle raisedsome money, before they went public, from venture capital, but it reallywasn’t needed.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How soon did Oracle go public?Lucas: It was about eight or nine years, something like that. We went public the sametime as Microsoft did, the same year.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I want to hear about that too.Lucas: There’s no story.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, there is to me in a general sense, in that I would like you to saysomething about how you figure out when it is time for a company to gopublic.Lucas: Yes, okay, just let’s get through that, because it’s really pretty straightforward.If you have something that’s fundamentally cutting-edge, leading, that people, industry, government want, hat you can sell at a profit, and it looks like it willbe able to grow significantly, like to $100 million-$500 million or larger,that’s the sort of thing. And management has the courage to put up with thepublic, which is a real big deal, then you should go public. Right now we havea hiatus on public offerings, which is a totally separate subject.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because of the recession.Lucas: Because of the financial discombobulation, yes. Some people think it’smore—I tend not to. But we have had a dearth of IPOs, which I think is badfor society as a whole. It’s certainly bad for the financial side. It’s certainlybad for the venture capitalists. But I think if you have these rudimentary necessities and the opportunity forthe investors to make a lot of money, then an IPO is appropriate. Now if youdon’t have those things, or don’t have those ambitions, then you shouldn’t gopublic! A lot of people go public to try to get liquidity for their stock, for theirstockholders. That’s not the reason to do it; it’s not for liquidity. The reasonfor it is to obtain growth capital and that you have significant financial growthahead.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Presumably somewhere in there, the climate of the stock market is going tofigure in. You’re implying that right now is not a very good time, even if youhave everything else.Lucas: But some companies just went public. Grand Canyon. One of my friends herejust took Grand Canyon public, an educational-type company. But this is moreof a debate which I don’t think may be appropriate for this. If you’ve got thosefundamental requirements, you can go public. That’s my position. And youshould go public if you want it—if you want the public ownership and needthe money.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: The fact that your co-investors are your friends, who, I presume, yes theywant their money out, but they wouldn’t be dealing with you unless theytrusted you at a certain level. So I imagine that the pressure for you to producereturns is probably a little bit less than it would be if it were an anonymouspool of limited partners who maybe could care less about the company. Theyjust want their money out, and they want it out in a reasonable amount oftime.Lucas: There’s a couple of interesting points here. One, I just want to help you onthis—going public isn’t the only route to liquidity. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I know that.Lucas: So you can sell the company.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, you can.Lucas: So selling a company gives you total liquidity. That’s real liquidity. And wedid that at Draper, Gaither & Anderson. We had a company and we neededsome cash. Remember I told you about our bank problem. Pete negotiated itactually, or maybe this was Crawford, I guess. Yes, Crawford. The president,was Allan Simpkins, he sold Delcon to HP for— We got a couple milliondollars in stock. So in many respects, that’s better than a public offering.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see that.Lucas: Because when you have an IPO you have to wait, and it’s only partialliquidity. You get a quote, but that doesn’t mean you can sell all your stocktomorrow.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: When a company is acquired, do you then wash your hands of it?Lucas: Well, I’ve already touched on this. For the most part, when we have sold acompany, it’s theirs. Now in the case of Tracor, which I mentioned to you, wehad sold them a number of companies, and I went on the board, and so it’s alittle bit different.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Okay, another area that we haven’t talked about— Do you invest in privatecompanies with the idea that eventually they’re going to be acquired or gopublic? Or is there some set of advantages to having a company remainprivate?Lucas: [Sigh] Well, you don’t realize how many buttons you’ve touched. Let’s just get through the reporting. As far as I’m concerned, once you start acompany, you want to be prepared to have a public company and have thecapability to report just as if you were a public company, i.e., SEC and SOX,et cetera. So I don’t look on it any differently. I want to have auditors auditingthe books. Some people don’t believe in that. I think it’s wrong not to do itthat way. You want to have that rigor, whether it’s public or private or whatever your objectives are. Some people differ with that. I don’t. So as faras the technical requirements, it makes no difference.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: This is a naïve question, but Sarbanes-Oxley applies only to publiccompanies?Lucas: Well, that’s a little complicated. In this respect, the government only hasauthority over public companies. But if you want to be public, you want to beable to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley. You can’t do that instantly, so it’s betterto practice from the beginning. And, my position is further than that—youwant to do things right in any case. So Sarbanes-Oxley doesn’t really pose aburden to me. You have a few additional requirements, but not substantive.You want your books to be right. Okay, let’s go back to the public/private. I hadn’t thought of it that way, butwe do not contemplate keeping the company private. We don’t invest with theidea of keeping it private. I don’t believe we’ve ever had a case of that. Butwhether or not it may be acquired or sold or IPO, we don’t look at itdifferently, we don’t look at that. We’re just looking for growth, success,profit, things like that.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So there would be nothing that you would—Lucas: Do differently.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Just anecdotally—Sally reading the New York Times business section--acquisitions seem to be such the thing these days. First of all, am I right aboutthat? And secondly, if I am, is there a particular reason why acquisitions forlegal or monetary or whatever reasons seem to be prevalent?Lucas: [chuckling] You don’t realize what a big question that is. If you’ve got a weekor two, bring your cot. [<|endoftext|>
Interviewer chuckles] Well, we’re in techland here, right?Silicon Valley. And so, it was easy to start companies here. It didn’t take a lotof money; it took some good ideas, et cetera. There are more companies thanare economic, so they should consolidate because you have the economies ofscale. See, that’s what we’ve done at Oracle. We’ve made, I don’t know howmany acquisitions, fifty, sixty, quite a few. We did the same thing at Tracor,the same with a number of other companies, i.e., Cadence.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Fifty or sixty acquisitions? Lucas: Yes. Nothing unique about that. But the thing is, people don’t fully understandthis, and many business people don’t, unless you’ve experienced theeconomies of scale, you don’t realize it. Like when Oracle bought PeopleSoftand people said, “Oh, it won’t work,” et cetera. When you brought the twocompanies together, you have the opportunities to cross-sell products to eachothers’ customers. We can sell them a database, right? And we had some appsto go along with their apps, and so cross-sell, up-sell, down-sell, et cetera. Soyou had a broader set of related products to sell people.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And that was what was firing the acquisitions?Lucas: Yes, and you only need one CFO; there’s not two CFOs, so you have theoperating economies of scale. And it worked just like the textbooks said itwould, and it was amazing. We’ve been doing this, as I say, for a long time,so there’s nothing new as far as “consolidation” goes. So, there’s theadvantage of scale. It’s happened in the car industry, it’s happened in thechemical industry, it happens in the steel industry. There’s nothing uniqueabout it. So there’s been a quite a number of acquisitions in this area, SiliconValley, because? Maturity.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Ah, it makes sense.Lucas: Yes. Nothing very complicated about it. And so there’s nothing magical aboutit. It does lead to more economic conglomerations and to, of course, somemistakes too. No question about that. So it’s a natural business evolutionarystep, so there’s nothing magical.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Give me an idea of what might go wrong—that the selling pattern that youenvisioned doesn’t materialize?Lucas: We go back to people. If you buy a hollow company, [if] the people whomade the company, like PeopleSoft, the technologists, the software engineers,et cetera, if they all leave, you’ve bought an empty bag. You don’t haveanything to cross-sell, up-sell. You’ve just got a bunch of overhead. Am Igetting through?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, I see.Lucas: The culture has to be compatible and things like that. So it’s not automatic,and there’s many examples of acquisitions that have failed. But I wouldsuggest one of the key ones is incompatibility of the key people. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: We’d better stop for a minute [for a tape change].Lucas: Okay. We’re stopping. But did you get that?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, I did get that. Culture actually was going to be one of my questions. AmI driving you nuts with my naïve questions?Lucas: No, no! They’re good questions. They’re not naïve.[End Audio File 3]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: All right. So we’re on the second tape. I think I probably know the answer tothe question of what you consider your greatest strength, but I’d still like youto say it.Lucas: Well, I’m open. And there are lots of things I don’t know, particularly when itcomes to technology, et cetera. So I cannot say to you in one word sort ofthing. But as I’ve said before, I think the most important thing is I invest inpeople, and I try to help people achieve the objective. And that’s thebeginning and the end.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, that’s what I thought you were going to say.Lucas: Yes, I know it is. [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I do get the theme!Lucas: Very simple.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, you, I think facetiously, said you didn’t want to talk about failures. But Ithink it would be instructive if you picked one that might be illustrative ofhow things can go wrong.Lucas: Okay. We try to excise those from our minds because if we thought aboutthem too much, we wouldn’t be able to go forward. My gracious! Well, we had this one venture—I even forget the name of it. It was in patient medicalrecords. And this maybe was ten, fifteen years ago. And Kaiser Health [Plan][million]-$15 [million] of our money, and it was a total failure. Sometechnicians from San Diego were involved, and a good friend of mine was aleader in it from the venture capital side. Why was it a failure? We were trying to change people’s way of doingsomething, and that’s really tough—particularly when they’re as arrogant asthe doctors. I was just over having my eyes checked by the head ofophthalmology at Stanford, and she was complaining about her medicalrecords. She couldn’t find my medical records. But they had a committeechasing this, and I said, “You should be on the committee. Because this isreally important.” But the medical record problem has not been solved, andit’s very difficult. However, I think it will be solved because the doctors havebecome more technically literate.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I thought Kaiser had everything online.Lucas: This was pre. I don’t know what their situation is exactly. But to get a medicalrecord, it takes everybody, all the participants—the nurses, the docs, theinstitution, the patient—all have to play a part. But we were too early.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, but you go back to the people. It’s still people.Lucas: Yes, oh of course.Norton: We have a Kaiser series of interviews, and there is some discussion of thiswhole thing in that series.Lucas: I think the company was up here. I’ve talked to the Kaiser head of IT; they’remajor customers of Oracle. We’ve chuckled about it, but we’ve all mademistakes. Medical records are a real problem. President Obama is planning tohave the government spend a lot of money in this area, and I’m very hopefulbecause it’s very important. We thought it was important then, and we stillthink it’s important, but it’s tough.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You act more independently than I picture most venture capitalists operating.What does that mean in terms of your relationships with those venturecapitalists when you’re in a deal together? Or does it make any differencewhatsoever? Lucas: I have a lot of good friends in venture capital. It’s not a question of arroganceor superiority or anything like that on my part. It’s just that this is the way Ilike to practice. And as I say, I’ve been with many of them as co-investors.We’ve had differences of opinion, but they’ve all worked out satisfactorily, Imean good, so I’m not being cagey about it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I’m sure your record of success has a lot to do with it too. How can you arguewith success?Lucas: Yes, well.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, shall we move to the larger context? Do you care to say anything aboutchanges at the Washington level that might have had direct impact on whatyou were doing? We mentioned Sarbanes-Oxley, and you said you’d alreadybeen doing that.Lucas: It’s incidental.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: There were things [federal legislation] happening in the late seventies thatfreed up pension money. Did you care?Lucas: That doesn’t affect me [pause to think]. To the extent there’s a viable financialsystem—we were close to not being very viable here. That’s the only thingthat would impact what we do.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You put that in the past.Lucas: Yes! America is through the most troublesome period, and we are on the wayup. It still is not apparent from the numbers, but we can see the way out of thismorass.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What are you looking at if not the numbers?Lucas: Well, I’m looking at the numbers, but they always speak different things todifferent people.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] That’s another theme! Lucas: I’m not an economist, but we just had this summit meeting at the StanfordInstitute for Economic Policy Research, in which we start at 8:00 and we gotill like 9:00 at night. And 500 people and some great economists—and it wasreally thrilling. We had Condi Rice start off the day, and it was marvelous.Some tears trickled down my face. I was truly thrilled. She was a friend. Iknew her before she went to Washington. It was just a wonderful, wonderfulinspirational talk on how she’s interested in children and education and allthese things. It was just wonderful. But then we got into the hardcore economic finance topics, and we had anumber of discussions. One session was Abby Joseph Cohen, from GoldmanSachs; she has been their guru in stock picking, and Dr. Michael [J.] Boskin,who happens to be a good friend of mine. He was chairman of the Counsel ofEconomic Advisors for the elder Bush, and he’s very bright. They really gotinto it. And then concluding was the chairman of Wells Fargo, DickKovacevich, who was quite outspoken and said he wished he’d never takenmoney from the government. And he didn’t want any control [by] thegovernment of his bank, et cetera. It was great to hear. They’re going to payoff the U. S. Government loan as soon as they can, which is great andappropriate. So you know, listening and reading beforehand and subsequently—theeconomy had some very serious problems. We had 1 percent interest for waytoo long a period of time, and we had a goal for our country started byPresident Clinton, continued by President Bush: everybody should have ahome, literally. And as a result, and Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, et cetera,too many people bought homes they couldn’t afford. And so there was anatural increase in demand, which shot prices up, and many people,unfortunately, that shouldn’t have bought homes. They had mortgages whichwere not going to be paid off. And these executives defaulted mortgagesmainly in our system, as well as the rest of the world, and these are reallytoxic assets.Yesterday, we finally got [Timothy] Geithner’s plan on how to,hopefully, get these bad mortgages out of the banking system and off to theside so the banks can go about their job of lending.But this was a very traumatic period: the banks stopped lending, and it was acrisis. So that’s why I spoke in the past tense. We know what the problem is;we’re doing something about it; we will solve it if we haven’t solved it. The stimulus is debatable, et cetera, and so I won’t get into that. But there’sgoing to be adequate stimulus, and so the economy will recover—humaninstincts sort of thing. If you don’t know what the problem is, you can’t solveit. But when you know what the problem is, even if it’s a big problem, adifficult problem, it will be done. We’ve got some great minds working on it,and we’re making great progress, so that’s why I put it in the past tense. I didn’t know anything about this mortgage business. I’m just shocked at whathappened—the mortgages that shouldn’t be given to the people, thefalsification, all that stuff. It is a disaster.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What about the due diligence and social responsibility you talked about?Lucas: The whole thing was a terrible mistake. The motive was good, but theexecution was poor.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I couldn’t help thinking as you were talking about how important you felt it tokeep the books right and also to be responsible to society. That’s not whatwe’ve been seeing, is it?Lucas: No. It’s very sad. The powers that be were complicit. The government in itsvarious arms was complicit. But I’m very optimistic.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, you sound that. But I think that’s your nature.Lucas: Oh yes, it is my nature. [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I would like your thoughts on this particular region, Northern California andspecifically Silicon Valley, being the background against which much ofventure capital has happened in this country.Lucas: Oh yes, that’s a subject that I’m fond of talking about. I come from SouthernCalifornia; I come from Ontario. And my brother got degrees at Berkeley; hisundergraduate at Davis, his master’s and his doctor’s at UCLA, he started atthe Max Planck Institute in Berlin. He instantly became the number two guyat Jet Propulsion Lab at Caltech. I mean to say, some of the smartest peoplethat we’ve had in technology have come from Caltech. I don’t want people tobe confused that we think we’re special in California. And of course, CMU[Carnegie Mellon University], MIT, up in Boston, and others are quitecompetent. California is a great place to live. I don’t think anybody can disagree with that.So it’s easy to recruit people to work here. And we have, this is my view, theSpanish heritage. That’s a welcoming sort of heritage, and we were broughtup that way, Californians were. So I think we assimilate others naturally,easily, don’t even think twice about it. That’s my impression. It hasn’t comeup, but where you come from, really, or where we’re going to have theoperations—we’re very flexible. As you know, we now have, many of our 60more people-intensive businesses are in India and China. They’ve gotten morepeople and they are less expensive so we naturally look that direction. And then we’ve been very fortunate to have great universities right here, suchas Berkeley and Stanford. And we do have a different way of looking attechnology. Like at the universities, it’s not the ideas—they’re not owned bythe university, they’re owned by the individuals. Now the university may getroyalties, et cetera, depending on the arrangement. I’m saying this as opposedto some Eastern schools that are not as open.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Have you seen that yourself?Lucas: Oh yes. And more willing to try. Like at National [Semiconductor] we copiedwhat Sperry Rand was doing. The guys came from Sperry Rand, and ourdoors got locked because we cheated. We came out here and came acrosssome engineers who wanted to make new semiconductors with differenttechnology, and we supported them, and we developed an outstandingcompany! Isn’t it amazing? And the people came from all over; from Europe,Israel, Eastern United States, China—a lot of Chinese scientists havecontributed a great deal. It’s an open society.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It’s another melting pot, a technological melting pot!Lucas: Yes, it is. There’s not the prejudice—I’ve not seen the prejudices. And Icertainly hope I don’t practice them of any kind, because who’s to say who’sbetter and who’s not. We try to get the best. We had some great leaders. I was fortunate enough to know both DavePackard and Bill Hewlett. And HP is a great role model, of course, likeStanford, et cetera. But they were great. Ethical, hard-working, cutting-edge,quality, high-profit margins.I touched on something that’s, I think, kind of interesting. I come fromSouthern California, obviously, and there is a difference: we had more theaerospace industry in Southern California, more government-supported, fixedprofits and less risk—and did a wonderful job—the space vehicles and theemployers, all that sort of thing. But up here it is typically proprietary, cuttingedge, high-profit-margin products. So I think that the very fundamentals uphere were of a different character.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That’s an interesting observation. I hadn’t heard that before. And more room,I would think, for venture capital investment. Lucas: More opportunities, not room, but more opportunities. Absolutely because—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, well, I’m thinking that the government was funding JPL and places likethat.Lucas: Yes. Tracor was government. We did a lot of work for the government, so youcan make money working, obviously, for the government. But here we getproprietary. And it just, of course, boomed. With Dr. [William B.] Shockleycoming out here, bringing his seven or eight other engineers from Bell Labs,just discovering a new way of making semiconductors.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Once the ball gets rolling, to use a bad cliché, then other bright minds that aresimilarly oriented are attracted. So it’s almost as though once you get themagnetism going, it’s going to take on a life of its own]. And then you’ve gotall of these other things in the environment, the research universities, and thebeautiful climate.Lucas: And plenty of room, physically, physically. So what is it that we didn’t have?We had everything to offer. We had a great country, we have a free enterprisesystem, and we’re a great part of a great country. I won’t say we’re the bestpart.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Arguably one of the most entrepreneurial.Lucas: But see that was what brought the people in—society was supporting theentrepreneur. See, it’s the people, and this was attractive. Now, I had a placeup at Jackson Hole, a wonderful place, but it’s kind of hard to live year round.It’s kind of hard to move around three or four months of the year.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: We’ve got five minutes. Please compare the second center of venture capital,namely that around Boston, Cambridge, route 128, all that. How is it or is itnot different, culturally or however you want to phrase it, from what youexperienced in Silicon Valley?Lucas: Well, as I told you earlier, I was involved with a number of companies in bothplaces. One is, the Boston area has a relatively much more rigid socialstructure. If you didn’t sign the Declaration of Independence, you’re nobody.My forbears came over from Europe, and we raised Belgian horses in Iowa,for goodness sakes, and then came out here, and there was land, and we tilledthe land. So it’s more open. Easier to develop new things. I have some wonderful friends back there, and I love it, and I have greatadmiration for their institutions and the cities and their culture, et cetera. Thatholds them back! We had nothing. There was no culture to be changed. It wasopen, fresh air, and make what you can of it. And fortunately, we had somepeople that came before me who just have done wonders.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What about tolerance for failure?Lucas: I don’t detect that being different. I think it’s more the social structure. Itwasn’t the thing to do. The thing to do here is to start a company, right? That’swhat these kids are doing, this Internet stuff. I don’t have a clue what they’redoing, but that’s the thing to do.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It used to be that you went into your father’s company.Lucas: And they had great companies and they’re great people. Here we just had awide-open opportunity. We had everything. We got the money from the East;the brains from the world would come here, right? And it’s a great place tolive. What more do you want? We’ve got it all! That’s called California. Sowe hope it stays that way.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I think we should probably stop there.Lucas: Great. Thank you. It’s been fun talking to you, Sally,<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I can’t tell you how much I’ve enjoyed learning from you.Lucas: Oh geez! Some people would really question your sanity if you say things likethat.
