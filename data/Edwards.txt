Interviewer: It is May 12, 2009, and it’s about 10:00 and we’re starting our first interview.Mr. Edwards—would you start way back with your grandparents, if that’sindeed the place to start?Edwards: Sure. Well, my father’s grandfather was in the Civil War; he died in that warand left his family with very little after the war, and his widow came west.They were in South Carolina, and she came west looking for somethingsomeplace so they could settle and do something, have some money to startsomething. And she got as far as northwestern Louisiana in a little town nowcalled Noble, which is just a wide place in the road; it’s just a nothing. Andshe had three sons, and they were with her, and one of those sons was mygrandfather. He had—wait a minute, let me get this straight [pause to think]—one of those sons was my grandfather. It went from my great-grandmother inSouth Carolina to her and her three sons in Louisiana. One of those sons married and had eight children. There were two boys andsix girls, and one of those boys, the youngest boy, second youngest child, wasmy father Leland Tabor Edwards. He had the benefits of a fifth-gradeLouisiana education. He learned to read, he learned to write, and he learned todo mathematics, fifth grade in backwoods Louisiana. He was born in 1885,and backwoods Louisiana it wasn’t much of an education. At a fairly earlyage, he went to work for a logging company, Pickering Lumber, in Louisiana,sharpening saws, axes. He ended up running the company store. He wasbright; he ran the company store in a company town where workers were paidin scrip. They used the scrip to go to the company store to buy whatever theyneeded.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And it was the lumber company that owned the town?Edwards: It was Pickering Lumber Company; they owned the town, owned the store,owned the timber around it. He worked there for a number of years runningthis store, and then he left and started a store of his own in backwoodsLouisiana. And he had three stores eventually, but he was still young. He wasin his twenties at this point. He was born in ‘85, and so this was sometimebefore 1915. His little sister, my aunt Mary Irene, married a man named Cleve Rogers.Cleve Rogers was a roughneck in the oil fields. A roughneck is a man thatworks on the floor of a drilling rig. It’s dirty, dangerous work. And his rig, therig he was working on, was up in, I guess, probably in northern Texas orfarther north in Louisiana. My father was going up to St. Louis on a buying trip for his little stores, and he stopped by this rig. And my aunt and my UncleCleve were living in a tent near the rig, which is what the work crew did. Hestopped by to see them on the way up to St. Louis and then on the way backstopped again, and Uncle Cleve was trying to get him to buy an oil rig and goin the oil business. Uncle Cleve talked him into it. His little sister didn’t like itat all, and she cried and cried when he did this. My father then sold his stores,bought an oil rig, and the two of them started out drilling oil wells. That wasway back in the teens. In 1921, they had a number of rigs. They’d expanded and the company wasprospering. In about 1920 there was a major discovery in California, whichturned out to be Signal Hill, a big oil field. Little in area, but huge reserves. Ithad 3,500 feet of pay sand in it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And where is it?Edwards: Long Beach.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh, Long Beach.Edwards: My father came out to have a look at it and wired my uncle and said, “Sendme a drilling rig and a crew.” He said, “We can do very well out here!” Andthey were competing against people that were not nearly as aggressive anddidn’t work nearly as well. They were competing against big companies thatwere running their own rigs in a very bureaucratic fashion. They did very welland moved the whole operation to California. In 1923 or so, my Uncle Clevebecame ill, sold his part of the company to my father. My father was notmarried; ’23 he was about 38 years old. So he took over the whole company and ran it. It was a pretty good sizecompany. He had seventeen rigs and 500 employees working for him. In1928, with no prescience about what was going to happen in the economicworld, he decided that he wanted a vacation. He’d never had a vacation, andhe wanted to do a little traveling, and he wanted to build a home. And so hesold his company. He didn’t like to delegate very well; he thought he could doeverything better himself and he probably could. So he sold his wholecompany in 1928 just before the Depression. He did what he wanted to do—built a home and did a little traveling and lost a lot of money during thatDepression, but we still lived comfortably. So that was the story of my fatherand my grandfather and my great-grandfather. My mother, Katharine Louise Knauf, on the other hand, came fromMinnesota, and she was the daughter of a farmer, and the farmer was a mannamed Henry Knauf, and Henry Knauf was of German extraction. Our records go as far back as, I don’t know, Dutch Peter Knauf, or something. Mymother’s family was a family of six children. They had three boys and threegirls, though at one time seven, because I had an Uncle George who died in anaccident back in the early part of the twentieth century. They were born on afarm; my mother and all those kids had to go into a nearby town calledWinona, southeastern Minnesota, to school. So my mother went to a littleschool in Winona and then went to Winona State Teachers College; she wasborn in 1894, and so this was the very early part of the twentieth century—Winona State Teachers College along with her two sisters. They all wentthere. No—the nearest two in age went there; my Aunt Mary went to WinonaState Teachers. Aunt Mary and Mother decided, in about 1921, that they were going to go toCalifornia. They were going to leave this little town in Minnesota, a littlefarming town, and come to California where the opportunities were better andthe weather was better. And they were just young girls, and they came toCalifornia and taught. My mother taught in a school in Beverly Hills and myaunt was in a school in Los Angeles. And my mother and father met about thattime—a boy from Louisiana with no education and this girl that had a collegeeducation. It was unusual. They were married in 1924; my brother was bornin ’26 and I was born in ’28. Is that what you wanted to hear?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, that’s what I wanted to hear.Edwards: Anything more on that?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I want to know what it was like growing up in your family and howmuch emphasis, if any, was put on education, with a father who had a fifthgrade education.Edwards: Well, he recognized how important education was because he was a veryuneducated man. He was in circles that were highly educated in those days. SoI’m sure he put heavy emphasis on education, and my mother, of course, wasinterested in education. So I was afforded whatever education I wanted,whatever education I could achieve. How much of my life do you want to gointo?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I’d like to hear a little bit more about what it was like growing up in thatfamily.Edwards: I grew up during the Depression. I was born in 1928, and the Depressionstarted a year later. And so far the whole community that we were in, I meaneverybody, it was the Depression. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were you in Long Beach?Edwards: Long Beach, California. They’d settled in Long Beach.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And you were living in the house that your father had—Edwards: We were living in the house my father built, yes. I was raised in that house. Itwas a lovely California Colonial home in Long Beach, and very comfortable,very lovely home.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now was Long Beach, in the twenties, dominated by the oil industry?Edwards: It was a principal industry in Long Beach. It was a place where people from the Midwest came to retire because theweather was good and the beach was fabulous, so we had a lot ofMidwesterners. The biggest event in the whole town every year was the IowaPicnic.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Iowa!Edwards: It was held in the park downtown. A small town; Los Angeles was next doorabout twenty miles away, and no freeways, of course, it was all surface roads.But Long Beach never really grew up because it was next to the city. If peoplereally were serious about buying something, they went to Los Angeles to buyit. And it had a kind of a truncated business district, because it was right onthe ocean. The town started on the ocean and the downtown part was on theocean, but it really only had 180 degrees of space because the rest of it wasocean. So it was kind of a funny little town, very provincial, very inwardlylooking.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And a town unto itself.Edwards: Yes, it was distinct from Los Angeles.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You didn’t feel as though you were an Angeleno.Edwards: No, no, there was a lot of open space between Los Angeles and Long Beach.Farms. There was the big Del Amo [Estate Company] properties that were land grant properties between Long Beach and Los Angeles. So it was a verykind of provincial little place.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, you, being born in ’28 probably can’t remember the Depression.Edwards: Oh I remember the Depression.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Can you?Edwards: Oh sure. Yes, I can remember darned socks and patched pants. We livedcomfortably, and we were in pretty good shape compared to most people, butI had many schoolmates that were not in good shape. We didn’t really thinkabout it that way. It was just the world. And that world was fabulous.Southern California in the twenties and the early thirties was wonderful. It hada little smog, which was particularly bad when there was freezing weather andthey smudged in the orange groves. Orange County was all orange trees.There was a little town out there, Santa Ana, but there was just all orangetrees. On a cold night they’d go out and light these smudge pots which burnedheavy fuel, and [gave off] a very dark smoke, and so forth. But it wasparadise! It was a wonderful—a beautiful beach and then you could look up atthe snow-capped mountains. If you were the right age, you could surf and skithe same day, really. It was a fabulous place to grow up. I just remember it asparadise. And I think the population of California then was, I would guess,maybe 7 million or something? It’s now in excess of 35 million. Hugechanges.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes. And particularly in that area.Edwards: In Los Angeles, yes. Huge.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, tell me a little about your brother. Were you close to him?Edwards: My brother Paul Henry Edwards was twenty-one months older, and we wereclose but competitive. [laughter] He tended to pound on me occasionally, andI gave back. [chuckling] But he was a very nice, very good-looking youngman.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What did he end up doing? Edwards: Well, he was born in ’26, and so in ’43 he was seventeen years old. The warwas going on, and he had wanted to go in the air force but was color blind andthey wouldn’t take him. And so he ended up going to the Great Lakes NavalTraining [Center] School in Chicago. And he was interested in being involvedin electronics in that school. In boot camp, in the winter of ’44 and early ’45,he caught pneumonia. He didn’t know it was pneumonia. There was no curefor pneumonia; you didn’t have any antibiotics in those days. He was about aweek or so from being through with boot camp and being able to go home,and I just know that he kept right on going. He didn’t want to have to get intosick bay during his leave, and he died.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh my God.Edwards: It was in January of ’45. It was a terrible shock to my family. A terrible shockto my parents and everybody. So anyway—then I was the only son at thatpoint.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you feel the burden of that?Edwards: The burden. Well, yes, feel the burden—yes, there was a big burden. Mymother had a very difficult time. She never really recovered from it. She wasparticularly affected and she turned to religion. She felt like she’d had acontact with the divine, and she was very interested in religion for the rest ofher life. It was hard adjusting my world to her world. It was kind of having afoot in two different places. So anyway, in my life that was a burden,definitely a burden. And then my father took it very, very hard, of course, aswell. But he weathered it much, much better than my mother. He was a fineman, and I admire him greatly for what he achieved. But he was—anyway,that was what happened and that was a great burden, a great burden. I didn’tfeel like it was a burden, but that’s what happened to me and I did it and livedthrough it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Where were you when he died?Edwards: Well, I’d been shipped off to New Mexico Military Institute. I was doingextremely well in Polytechnic High School in Long Beach. I was straight-Aand California Scholarship Federation, or whatever it was, and involved in allsorts of social things and having a great time. My father had heard about thisschool, New Mexico Military Institute. In all honesty, I had a really beautifulgirlfriend [laughter]. She turned out to be the homecoming queen at USC andthen married Frank Gifford. My father, I think, was afraid that I’d dosomething that I regretted, and I never would have, no possible way. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You mean get married and that would be it?Edwards: No, getting married is completely out, and having a child out of wedlock wasout of the question. No possible way. But anyway—so that could have beenthe reason, or it could have been because New Mexico Military Institute wasrun by the army. It was a National Guard school. It was a school in theSouthwest in Roswell, New Mexico, and it had a lot of kids that would comein from ranches all around the Southwest, a place where they couldn’t get agood education.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: My father went there.Edwards: New Mexico Military Institute?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes!Edwards: I regard it as a penal colony! But anyway.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Really! I never talked to him about it, unfortunately.Edwards: Well, it was—they practiced the same practices that they do at Annapolis.And they had corporal hazing the first year you were there. I think atAnnapolis they call them plebes and in New Mexico they called them rats. Iwent in as a rat and I had these little kids, who were tenth graders—I was ajunior in high school at that point. I was in the eleventh grade, I guess. Andlittle kids—they had the ability to give me corporal punishment. It was not anice place. I didn’t like it at all. It had, I suppose, many useful aspects in therest of my life, but it was tough discipline. And it was a very strict militaryschool.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And what about the education?Edwards: Adequate.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was this through high school?Edwards: No, just the two years for me, the last two years of high school. It was a fouryear school but I was in Long Beach for the first two years. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Okay, the last two.Edwards: But you came out of there a lieutenant in the cavalry. Not out of high school,but after two years of junior college you came out as a lieutenant in thecavalry, so that was one of the things he was thinking about and the otherthing was—possibly—I’m just second guessing. He never mentioned a word,but she was a beautiful girl. [chuckling]. Anyway, so I went there. And was it good for me? I had nothing to do butstudy and sports, really very little to do but that. So I studied. We had acompulsory study hall every night. And we had to be in our rooms and wewere observed in our rooms. So I’d do my homework, and then I’d be sittingthere at my desk and I’d do it again! So my grades were very good there, butwhen it came time to go to college, I’d really had very little—there wasnobody there that really gave me any advice on college. My father, of course,wasn’t really able to give me advice, and my mother—they knew nothing, notmuch about Harvard and Princeton and so forth. So I applied to Caltech andStanford. Caltech didn’t have the SAT. They had their own entrance exam,and I took that. I couldn’t even read it! They had math and physics and all thesciences that I had never come into contact with at all at New Mexico. So Ididn’t get into Caltech, obviously. [chuckling] There were problems on thattest that I couldn’t even understand. I had no idea how to go about solvingthem.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, it was a very—still is—a very elite science-oriented school.Edwards: A great school, a great school. But I did get into Stanford, and that was it! Iapplied to two colleges, and one of them I didn’t get close to getting into andthe other one was easier. So I went to Stanford and then went to Harvard.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now did you have any idea what you wanted to major in?Edwards: No, I was drawn toward engineering and science, and so I ended up as apetroleum engineer. I got involved in engineering, but I came from an oiltown. The people that lived on the street that we lived on were mostly oilpeople, and I had a mentor who was a geologist in the oil fields. So that was—I sort of naturally gravitated. I became a petroleum engineer. And I alwaysthought I would learn the business and then go out and start trying to developproduction on my own.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Meaning creating a— Edwards: Drilling oil wells.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, but creating your own company around it.Edwards: Right. I wanted to work for myself. From a very early age I wanted to workfor myself.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, wasn’t that an influence of your father?Edwards: Oh yes. Oh my father had great influence on me! One—he was a man ofprinciple, and honesty and integrity were important to him. I never heard himswear. We did a lot of fishing together, and the worst thing I ever heard himsay was goddawgit if he hooked himself in the ear or something like that.[laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was he a religious man?Edwards: No, well, he was a Christian. My mother was a Catholic; my father was aProtestant. And he was irreligious and he didn’t attend church regularly. Andmy mother didn’t attend church after my father and mother were married. Myearly training in religion was at the Episcopal Church in Long Beach. Inensuing years I attended many different churches and looked around, and soforth. But what was the question again?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, we’re talking about Stanford, and I’m just looking at when you werethere—it was two years after the war was over.Edwards: I went there in ’46.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Forty-seven by my calculation.Edwards: I was there for five years. I went in ’46.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh so ’46 right after the war.Edwards: Right after the war. The biggest entering freshman class that Stanford had forthe next twenty-five years or thirty years was that class. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because of the GI Bill?Edwards: It was the GI Bill and the guys coming back from war. So Stanford went outof its way to try to bring as many of those guys in as they could without justdivorcing themselves from the public high school system or the high schoolsystem. And so there were 1400 or 1500 people in our entering freshmanclass.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What did that do to your education?Edwards: It richened it. Yes. I joined a fraternity there, and it was about half veteransand half non-veterans. It was with the more mature people although youwouldn’t really know it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Who knew what they wanted to get out of education?Edwards: Well, they’d been out in the world, but they were glad to be alive, and theywere having a really good time, and they were working. And they werelooking forward to getting out of college and getting married and having afamily and starting their lives. In those days you got married at twenty totwenty-five.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, you talked off-tape about Stanford’s influence in Silicon Valley and[Frederick E.] Terman and that whole story. How much were you aware ofwhat Stanford was doing?Edwards: Not aware. Well, it was ’46. Silicon Valley didn’t really start until the latefifties. At the very beginning, you might say there was something like SiliconValley. You had Hewlett-Packard and the Varian brothers and a few othercompanies around, but that was the beginning. When I was at Stanford,Silicon Valley was all prune and apricot groves. It was beautiful going downthere in the spring and seeing all these fruit trees blossoming.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I can’t remember whether Terman was provost at that time.Edwards: He probably was later—he became the provost. He was the dean of the Schoolof Engineering, I think.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And he was already reaching out into industry, was he not? Edwards: Well, he would encourage Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to start HewlettPackard. And they were both students of his. That was a very seminal thing inSilicon Valley. That was one of the things that I think marked the beginningof it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That was after your time as an undergraduate?Edwards: I think they started in—I want to say ’39? Now can that be?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I think you’re right. It was before your time. [rustling sounds] Sorry,I’m hitting the microphone in my enthusiasm! [chuckling]Edwards: It was before my time. But they were starting. They were just making theirfirst instrumentation devices.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And an undergraduate wouldn’t be paying attention.Edwards: I didn’t pay any attention. Come on! I was pretty unsophisticated. I had comefrom two sort of Victorian-type parents. I was not a highly sophisticatedperson but I did enjoy my engineering and my education. First I spent fouryears, basically, mostly engineering. It had a lot of requirements and stuff.And then I spent a fifth year there taking all the courses that I’d heard aboutfor the first four years but couldn’t take because I didn’t have the time anddidn’t really know about them. But I took philosophy and history and actuallyI took a course in Music 1 and a course in Art 1 which have been immenselyenriching to my life. Well, as I say, I took some literature; I took a marvelouscourse from Marge [Margery] Bailey, who was a renowned Shakespeareanteacher. She was a fabulous teacher, and it was an experience being in herclass. I did that sort of thing for an extra year and rounded out my education.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That seems to me quite amazing, considering where you came from. I wouldthink the more routine path would have been, all right, I’ll get my degree, getout there, get a job, form my company, because that’s what your backgroundhad pretty much been.Edwards: Well, to tell you the truth, I had one course that I hadn’t taken that I neededfor a degree in petroleum engineering, and it was a useless course to me. Itwas petrology. Petrology is the study of igneous and volcanic rocks—notsedimentary. [chuckling] The whole petroleum industry is sedimentary rock.This was totally a— And I had that course to take, and basically, in all honesty, I went back to Stanford for that one course and spent a year, whichwas a great year.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So you might as well fill it up with courses.Edwards: Well, I didn’t have to spend a year there, but it meant that missing class atHarvard when it started in September. So I did spend a year and because Ireally wanted to. I’d been hearing about history courses and literature coursesand stuff for four years, and I hadn’t been able to take them, and so I tookthem and enjoyed that immensely.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How did a petroleum engineering degree help or not in what was to come?Edwards: Well, one, just the technical stuff. You learn a whole new language when youtake physics and chemistry and so forth. It was a whole new language that youlearned on the various engineering courses. And also, I think the discipline ofhaving answers, not essay-type answers but the answers is good training. Alsoit’s a hindrance, because I’ve always wanted to have the answer, and theanswer in venture capital—there is no the answer.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did that bother you?Edwards: Yes. I like—it’s comforting to have an answer that you know is right. Thenalways to be sort of in a never-never land is—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, then I could ask, and I know we’re leaping ahead—why did you chooseventure capital? A discipline with no definite answer.Edwards: I didn’t choose venture capital! Venture capital chose me. It wasserendipitous!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Okay. [chuckling]Edwards: And I was—Standard [Oil] of California. I went to work for Standard of Calbecause they would drill more oil wells in a year than I would drill myself infive years, ten years. And I wanted to learn how to drill wells and completewells and so forth. I needed to learn the tools of my trade going intoproduction. And after I’d been in the field for three-and-a-half years—and bythe way, I was hired by Standard of Cal at Harvard, and they could have sentme anyplace. I didn’t ask for anything—and they sent me back to the L.A. Basin, which was terrific! I went back to my own home—I went back andslept in my own bed!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And that was just chance that they did that?Edwards: Just chance, yes. I mean, they had a big operation down there, and that’swhere they wanted me and they put me there. And so after three-and-a-halfyears they decided they wanted me at the headquarters, and they were kind ofmoving me along. So I responded and came to the headquarters. I was marriedat that point; I had one child with a second child almost here. So I moved,came up here, and told my wife to pick a place to live, and I would commute.So I did that. She picked a place in Atherton, which happens to be on thenorthern rim of Silicon Valley.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Where you still live?Edwards: Still live.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: In the same house.Edwards: No, not the same house. We built a home there later.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I skipped you past, and I apologize—I skipped you past Harvard BusinessSchool. I think Standard Oil is going to lead directly into venture capital.Edwards: Not directly. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh all right. But anyway, I want to hear what happened at Harvard BusinessSchool.Edwards: Well, I enjoyed it very much. I think of my years—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But why?Edwards: Why Harvard Business?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes. Edwards: Well, it was part of my background I wanted to have for building a company.And it’s good training.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But you could have gone to Stanford Business School.Edwards: Well, I’d been at Stanford for five years and I’d done everything you could doat Stanford for five years. Harvard, in those days, was a better school, a morerenowned school. I don’t know if it was better, but it was better known. And itgave me a whole new world. I moved back to the East Coast. I’d never livedon the East Coast; I’d never lived through snowy, cold winters. The wholething was very fresh, but I liked it too!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, what did you get out of the coursework?Edwards: Well, it was all case studies, and you solve problem after problem afterproblem after problem after problem, in various segments of business. Youhave finance and procurement and all sorts of things—business policy and onand on and on.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It sounds very real-world oriented. Was that the idea?Edwards: Yes. This is all casework. So they give you a problem, and you either take itand go to class and discuss it, or you write a paper on it. So you spend yourdays solving business problems. Good training.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, and it proved to be good training?Edwards: Oh I think so. It’s hard to take a formal education and point at some particularthing you’ve done that says this affected it. But I think that whole process ofeducation was terrific. I’ve always enjoyed education. I have never stoppedlearning. It’s very important to me. I’ve had teaching company tapes—if youknow what they are. They’re college-level courses, and I have audiotapes andI have them in my car. I’ve gotten another two degrees, I guess, by justlistening to these tapes!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: On all kinds of subjects?Edwards: And I was listening to one as I drove in here today. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Any particular subject?Edwards: Well, it’s mostly religion, history, mostly those. Philosophy, nothing muchtechnical, although I have one on CDs at home that was on geology. Mygeology goes back to 1950, and there’s been some major changes. Not many,but some major changes since 1950, and it’s been interesting for me to goback and take that course. Plate tectonics was not known in those days, andnow it’s very fundamental.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Exactly.Edwards: Anyway, I love learning, I’ve continued to learn, and I think learning is alifetime process.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Good philosophy. Well, one more question about Harvard Business School.There are a number of people in venture capital who went to HarvardBusiness School. One of the perks is the people you meet and the connectionsthat you establish.Edwards: I have some dear friends from Harvard Business School.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, do you want to talk about how—Edwards: Well, one of the reasons I liked it was that I met some really terrific peoplethere, and I really enjoyed the people a lot, and they were from the variousschools. You got a good look at Harvard-, Princeton-, Yale-type peoplecoming out of those schools, and so forth. But I enjoyed the people a lot. Ihave never particularly benefited from any of the people that I met there, but Ihave a lot of good friends that went to Harvard, and I talk to them and stay intouch with them.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was your intention always to come back to the West Coast?Edwards: In the oil business you go where the oil is, and oil’s in some pretty awfulplaces! [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You were willing to do that? Edwards: Well, I was willing to start out that way, but I would have preferred being inCalifornia. There was a lot of oil in California, a lot of oil. I could stay hereand work, sure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Let’s put your wife in this picture. How did you meet her?Edwards: Which wife? I’ve had two wives.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: The first wife.Edwards: Well, her name was Betty Cree, and she moved in sort of around the cornerfrom where I lived when she was ten. She had two brothers—an older brotherand a younger brother. The older brother was in my brother’s class; theyounger brother was two years younger. A tall, blond, lovely, lovely,woman—intelligent. And I’d known her since I was ten years old! But she hadskipped the second grade, and so I was a year behind her in school. I shouldn’thave been because we were the same age, but she jumped ahead. So she wasalways the girl in the class ahead of me, and we didn’t have anything to dowith each other, particularly, except knew each other well. And then she wentto Scripps College. She wanted to go to Wellesley, but her father and motherthought oh you can’t get that far away! You’ve got to be here. Which Ithought was criminal. She wanted to go to Wellesley. Did I say Scripps?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes.Edwards: She went to Scripps but she wanted to go to Wellesley, which would havebeen wonderful for her. She would have benefited enormously. I was in myfifth year at Stanford when she— I guess she got her master’s degree ineducation about that time. No, I think she was out of school three years beforeI was out of school, with a master’s degree. And then I went back to Harvard,and when she was at Stanford we went out a bit. When I was at Harvard wewent out a bit, and we were married the 13th of March 1954. She was abeautiful, wonderful, decent, honest, bright woman.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I can see that you have four children. Is she the mother of all four?Edwards: Yes, she is. And there are six children in that one over there [indicating familyphoto]. I was then single for five years after she died, just before her fiftiethbirthday and my fiftieth birthday, in 1978. I was single for five years lookingfor the lady I’m married to now. And she came with two daughters—and Ididn’t really want to raise any more children. I’d had quite a bit of trouble with my own daughter, and it was not easy, not easy! [chuckling] I thought,oh my God, I can’t do that. But she was so wonderful—hopeless!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So did you at one point have all six children under one roof?Edwards: No, we never did. There was sixteen-and-a-half years’ difference in my ageand Barbara’s, so my older children have sort of an avuncular feeling towardher daughters! And my son Paul sort of feels like their brother, but he’s a gooddeal older. They’re thirty-six and thirty-three, and he’s just about fifty.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: He’s about fifty!Edwards: He will be in September.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: He doesn’t look it.Edwards: Well, it’s a life well-lived, I’d say.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes. Is there anything more you want to say about Harvard Business School?Edwards: I enjoyed the whole scene. I liked the community; I liked all the intellectualattractions in it. I loved the Harvard Chapel; it was a great place. Stanford hadhad not much in the way of a chapel. Harvard had a good one, and it hadworld-renowned theologians coming in and preaching the sermon, and soforth. It was wonderful and I loved it. I liked the experience of being in thesnow and the cold and trying to drive around on icy roads. It was anexperience.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You liked that?Edwards: No, I didn’t like that much, but I survived! So did my car.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, you talked a little bit about Standard Oil and how you ended up in LosAngeles by chance. You were there for six years or something like that?Edwards: Six-and-a-half years at Standard of Cal.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you go into that with the idea that this might be your career? Edwards: Standard of Cal?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes.Edwards: No, it seems to me that there are people that are big company people,bureaucratic kind of people, and there are people that are maybe middle-sizecompanies, smaller companies where they’re working with a lot of otherpeople, and there are people that want to be on their own. I’m one of the onesthat wants to be on his own. And I always wanted to run my own show.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You had a family to support and this was a good way to start out? Was thatkind of your thinking for taking the job?Edwards: I didn’t have a family when I went to work for them; I was at Harvard, when Iinterviewed for a job. They could have sent me anywhere, but they sent meback to the L.A. basin.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I guess then my question is if you knew that you wanted to start out on yourown—was that an impossibility at that stage?Edwards: No, it wasn’t impossible.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why didn’t you do that then?Edwards: I wanted to learn.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh, okay. [chuckling]Edwards: Drilling an oil well is a complicated thing, and I’d just as soon be trained, andso forth—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh all right, you kind of said that, yes.Edwards: —as opposed to do the whole thing on my own nickel. I mean, it would havebeen very expensive! [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So this was another education sort of. Edwards: Yes, it was just preparing for what I was going to do.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And it took seven years to get the education that you thought you needed?Edwards: Let me finish my story! [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh, all right. I’m sorry.Edwards: Once I was at Standard of Cal and came to the headquarters and was workingat various jobs, it became clearer and clearer to me that the world was awashin oil. Standard of Cal had discovered oil in Saudi Arabia in 1939, and the warinterrupted all that. But as they developed Saudi Arabia—just [a] massivereserve of oil—and the oil business is such that the big companies wouldprefer to produce their own oil, refine their own oil, and market their own oilproducts. There’s some advantages in the production because you have taxpreferences, and the rest of it all goes together very nicely. And so, theywould rather produce and refine, and so forth, their own oil; oil they boughtfrom others was a secondary thing, and if they didn’t need it, they didn’t buyit, and if they needed it they bought it. So the independent producer was kindof a surge thing that would have good years and bad years. That becameapparent to me as I really got into it as I was working in the corporateheadquarters, and so forth. I decided that maybe a career in the oil business was not a good idea becausedeveloping oil in a world where there was lots of oil was not that interesting.And so I decided to change jobs, and I went into money management. I wentwith a national money management firm called Lionel Edie, headquarters inNew York and offices around the country, several offices, and it was to gointo the investment business. And about the time that I left Standard of California, a friend of mine came tome, and he was involved in a little company, a private company, and theywere trying to raise more money and asked me if I’d be interested in investingin it. I looked at it and put in a little money. It was in 1959, and I didn’t haveall that much money, but I put some in and it worked out pretty well.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Money that you happened to have saved?Edwards: Yes. My father gave me some money. So that worked out well! And lookingback, that was my first private investment. Then I had a broker in SanFrancisco— I had called a friend of mine from Stanford and Harvard—Bill[William K.] Bowes. Have you talked to Bill? 20<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh yes.Edwards: Well, Bill’s a very bright guy, very bright, and well worth listening to, andhe’s a wonderful man. But I’d called him when I first came to San Franciscowith Standard of Cal and I’d said, “Do you know a good stock broker intown?” Interviewing Bill must have been really interesting because he doesn’ttalk a lot.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: He doesn’t.Edwards: I’d be curious to see that interview!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, it took some doing, but he’s also just a real charmer.Edwards: Oh he is. I want to tell you, he is a wonderful man; he is a wonderful person!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You just have to be patient. It comes out.Edwards: You have to be really patient with Bill! [laughter] But I called Bill and I said,“Bill, are there any good brokers in town? Can you advise me on a goodbroker?” Typical Bowes, he says, “John Bryan.” Two words. John worked forthe same company he was with. He was with Blyth and Bill was aninvestment banker. So I met John Bryan, in about ’57, I guess. So John and Iwould talk investments, and then he would advise me on investing and soforth. He was a good man, a wonderful man, as it turns out. He was mypartner for many years. A fine man. So he had made what would be a ventureinvestment, and I think he made it in about 1955 or something. It was acompany called Memorex which made magnetic tape and discs forinstrumentation and for computers.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Bill [William H.] Draper had a connection, did he not?Edwards: Memorex? I don’t think so. Bill came out in about ’59 or ’60, I think. He waswith Inland Steel and he came to the Bay Area. His father started a ventureoperation.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Draper, Gaither & Anderson. Edwards: Draper, Gaither & Anderson. And that was financed by—a name that’smillion for that firm. They had a big operation and a beautiful building downnear Stanford.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I know we’re diverting, but that partnership is put forward by Bill and othersas the first real venture capital company.Edwards: On the West Coast. In the East there was General [Georges] Doriot atHarvard; he had a company called American Research and Development.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Right.Edwards: There was the Whitney family and the Rockefeller family and Mrs. [JoanWhitney] Payson, in New York. Those were all very wealthy families that hadlots of money, and part of it was going into venture capital. And they weredoing it seriously; they were making an effort.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And were they calling it venture capital?Edwards: No, it wasn’t called venture capital, it was just private investment. I don’tremember when they started calling it venture capital, but it must have been inthe sixties sometime. Then they’d say, “What are you?” And I’d say, “I’m aventure capitalist.” And they’d say, “What’s that?” Nobody knew what it was.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Draper, Gaither & Anderson, as I remember, was founded around ’60 or ’61. Iwonder if it was labeled venture capital at that time.Edwards: No, I don’t think so. You’d have to ask Bill, but I don’t think it was. I think itwas just private capital. And we had some others—we had Ed [Edward H.]Heller, who worked for Schwabacher and Company here in San Francisco. Hewould do ventures. They said what you did if you wanted money from EdHeller—you would slide your proposal under his office door, and then he’dslide back five thousand dollars! [laughter] But he did get involved with somereally good things. In fact, one of them was Raychem, where he made a lot ofmoney.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And that brings in another connection. Way back I talked with Moshe Alafi.Edwards: Oh yes. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It seems to me that it was Heller that gave Moshe his first backing.Edwards: Could well have been—he would back anything a little bit.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Raychem was one of Alafi’s early companies as well.Edwards: He could have been an investor in it. It was Paul [M.] Cook’s company.There was a wonderful story about Ed Heller. He had a number ofgrandchildren, and he was trying to give them all money. And the youngestgrandchild he gave Raychem stock to, and Raychem stock was a rocket! It justtook off. So he had one wealthy grandchild and all these othergrandchildren— Which caused a problem, which is something I’ve thoughtabout a lot!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Maybe it’s better to portion out a bit.Edwards: But not to lock yourself in, and you try to deal with everybody on an equalbasis.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is that a good place to switch the [tapes]? I took the story away from you.Edwards: What story?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, you’re still at Lionel Edie, right?Edwards: Edie, E-D-I-E [spells], Lionel Edie.[End Audio File 1]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: This is tape number two. It’s still May 12, and I’m still talking with Mr.Edwards—and I’m still Sally <|endoftext|>
Interviewer! [chuckling]. So let’s pick up at LionelEdie. You were there quite some time; you were there almost nine years. Edwards: I was there nine years, but all that time, as I say, the first venture deal I did,that I would consider was a venture deal, was in 1959 and that’s when I wentto work for Lionel Edie. That venture came along about three months after Iworked for Lionel Edie. I had some friends; Reid Dennis was working forFireman’s Fund, Bowes was working for Blyth; Bill [William H.] Draper wasworking for Draper, Gaither & Anderson, [Franklin] Pitch Johnson came outfrom Inland Steel. He’d been a fraternity brother of mine when I was incollege, and he was my best man when I got married.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh really!Edwards: Yes, and so he and Bill formed Draper & Johnson.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It’s incestuous. [chuckling]Edwards: Sixty-one, ’62.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So everybody’s connected to everybody.Edwards: This group—we were friends. Outside of venture capital we knew each other;we’d been at Stanford more or less the same time. Reid’s a little older than Iam; Bowes was in the war. As I say, I did the first investment in ’59 and 1960I did another one. I can’t remember what it was— It was Beckman andWhitley; it was a little company that nobody in his right mind would invest in. Beckman and Whitley was started by John Beckman, and it had three productsthat were basically John’s hobbies; things that he was interested in. One ofthose products was extremely fast photography. If you’ve seen pictures of abullet going through a window or going through an apple or something andyou can see little teeny segments—that was one of John’s cameras. It wasbased on a whirling turbine with mirrored blades, and every time a blade wentby, it recorded a picture. And the blades were going very fast. So that was onebusiness. The next one was explosively actuated devices, like you’d haveexploding bolts, when they separate a rocket from one stage to two stages of arocket, or in an oil refinery fire you could have an explosive actuated valve—avalve to close very quickly and remotely; you’d use a little explosive chargeto close the valve—that kind of thing. And the other product wasmeteorological devices; three businesses that had nothing to do with eachother at all! [chuckling] Anyway, so we went into that.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And you did that because you respected him? Edwards: No. I was working for Lionel Edie.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I know that. But why—I mean, there probably were many ways that you couldhave invested your money.Edwards: As I said, we didn’t know anything about venture capital, and Bowes had beeninvolved in investment banking. But there was nobody teaching us how to doventure capital, we just did it. Beckman and Whitley was a terrible idea. Itworked out all right because somebody bought it. A company called TechnicalOperations bought Beckman and Whitley because they wanted something thatBeckman and Whitley had. So we got out of it and made money with it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see.Edwards: But starting a company based on a man’s three hobbies that are totallydifferent is a really bad idea, a really bad idea! [<|endoftext|>
Interviewer chuckles] Nobodywould do that, but we did it. So then in ’60 I did another investment or two,and then in ’61 I did another couple investments. In ’59 Congress had passedthe SBIC [Small Business Investment Company] Act—you know what that is.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes.Edwards: And they were making it attractive for people to do venture investing, becausethere wasn’t much venture investing going on and they could see that it wasimportant. One of the few things that Congress did right. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Reid Dennis talked about the SBIC, and not always positively, as it turned out,but I haven’t heard anybody talk about the federal side of it. What did promptthis and who was behind it in the Congress?Edwards: I don’t know who was behind it in Congress. It was part of the Small BusinessAdministration. The SBIC project was put in the Small BusinessAdministration operation. It was valuable in those days because there wasn’tmuch venture capital. There might have been a little venture capital in the EdHellers and people like that here, and then the Draper, Gaither & Andersons,but there wasn’t anything anyplace else—in Minneapolis or anywhere. So ithad a purpose. Now Reid spoke badly of it because it’s no longer needed here.It might be needed in Omaha or someplace that has no venture capital and hasnone of the milieu that we live in, so it can be useful. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I don’t want to put words in his mouth, but as I remember what he saidwas eventually it became so bureaucratic that—Edwards: Oh it’s awful.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That it wasn’t the way to go anymore.Edwards: See John and I—we were doing these things and we were using our own cashand that’s all we had. The SBIC program had some advantages. It gave youfour to one leverage; for every dollar you put in, the government would loanyou four dollars—loan—on good terms, ten year terms at a government-levelkind of interest rates. They were trying to encourage people to do venturecapital. And so that was a big positive. So John and I were makinginvestments of $10,000 or something in those days, and we were all workingtogether. We took what little money we had and would get together and do adeal, because together we’d have enough money to do something butindividually we didn’t.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now if the government is behind this, they must presumably have a widernational purpose. I don’t remember what was going on in the late fifties, butwas there worry about the United States maybe losing out in terms ofinnovation and international competitiveness?Edwards: I doubt it. We had done very well economically as a nation for a long time.And in 1959, we were by ourselves in the world. Nobody had anything exceptus. We had to rebuild Europe and rebuild Japan and that whole process wasgoing forward. We weren’t frightened of anything. And I don’t think anybodyin government really knew what they were doing, because I don’t think theyever know, really, what they’re doing. [<|endoftext|>
Interviewer chuckles]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Are you a libertarian?Edwards: I’m not a libertarian, but I’m close! I’m close. It’s just awful what governmentdoes—just awful. Who was this kid that was in “Home Alone”? [LindaNorton, the videographer, says Macauley Culkin] Macauley, yes. I saw a greatpicture. It was Macauley, and he had a surprised look on his face. Aneconomist was talking about what’s going to happen to the next generation.So Macauley’s there thinking oh my God! What are they doing! I’m going tohave to pay for all that! And that’s what’s happening now. It’s crazy. Butanyway—what were you talking about? <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, we were talking about the genesis of the SBIC and it sounds as though itwasn’t founded because—Edwards: No, it was a good idea. It was a good idea.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: —of any economic downturn in the United States. Those were still the postwar boom years.Edwards: Yes. I think someone in Congress realized that it would be good if we hadmore small companies starting, and so forth. And I don’t think he had any ideawhat was going to happen. And I think that whole program now, with theexception of maybe some little areas in the nation where they don’t haveaccess to venture capital—it’s not needed. Here in Silicon Valley it hasn’tbeen needed for—how long—thirty years? There’s money here; lots ofmoney.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because there are people like you.Edwards: Yes. Well, I had an SBIC, of course, in those early days. But then in theeighties I got so tired of all the bureaucratic nonsense that I had to go throughwith this SBIC and all the stupid stuff that I just disbanded it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Are we then up to Bryan and Edwards?Edwards: No, it hadn’t started. John is still working at Blyth, and I’m still working atLionel Edie, and we’re doing ventures—evenings, weekends, any old time.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But you have an SBIC.Edwards: He had an SBIC and I had an SBIC and they were identical. John has fourchildren and I have four children. We’re sharing our SBICs with our childrenand our wives.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What does that mean?Edwards: Oh it was a corporation, and they all owned stock. They all owned stock in it,so as I prospered, they prospered. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And is that the way SBICs worked generally? That the family were investorsor stockholders?Edwards: No, no. Most SBICs were set up as little corporations, and they went out andraised the money and then they got four-to-one leverage.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, that’s what I thought. How did you do—Edwards: I just did a private one. Family-owned. All mine.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And the government was perfectly happy with that.Edwards: Sure. Well, why wouldn’t they be? One, I was a terrific citizen. I did all thethings they wanted me to do. I followed all the nonsense they wanted me todo. I paid them back their money. They couldn’t have been happier, I wouldthink!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What did they look at?Edwards: Every investment, twice a year.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And in the past, too? Those bureaucrats running the SBIC must have looked atyour track record.Edwards: I don’t know what they did. Every year we had SBIC guys coming throughwith the audit, and so forth. They were not bright bulbs. [<|endoftext|>
Interviewer chuckles]They were not. They were very bureaucratic lower-level-type governmentpeople, and it was just ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What were they doing? Looking at your books?Edwards: Yes, they’d go through all the books, every investment, all the papers, and soforth. They were all there.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So how long did that last?Edwards: How long did I have an SBIC? <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes. And where did it get you?Edwards: Well, it got me a lot of money! [laughter] I made a lot of money.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Which was the whole idea, wasn’t it!Edwards: But in, I guess, the mid-eighties—I don’t know when it was. I finally just gottired of it and I paid them back all their money. When we first did our SBICs,the only form of SBIC they did was corporation, and so here I had acorporation which I owned part of and my children owned part of. Theyowned half and I owned half. And after my wife passed away in ’78, I didn’twant my kids wound up in a corporation. If the corporation existed, and one ofthem ended up as president or chairman or whatever and the others weren’t,there’d just be a battle. There’d be a squabble because somebody was gettinga better deal than somebody else, and somebody wanted money and somebodyelse didn’t want money, and they’d be pulling and tugging. And so as soon as they made it possible to have an SBIC that was apartnership, I ended my corporation and started a partnership. That was a veryexpensive move because it was a taxable event, and I still owned the samethings I’d owned before but I’d paid a huge amount of taxes on making thatmove. But then my children were not attached to each other. They’re everyone of them totally independent. There’s nothing they have to agree on unlessthey want to agree, because I don’t want to leave a family that’s battling. Lotsof families end up just battling each other, hating each other, suing each other,wasting the family’s assets squabbling over something. I didn’t want that, so Ihave it set up so that when I die what I have goes to each of them, and they’renot bound together. If they want to do whatever they want to do they can do it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Very clever.Edwards: That’s what I did.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now all this is happening and you’re still with an investor counselor. Youhaven’t yet started—Edwards: Bryan and Edwards.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: There’s something before Bryan and Edwards, isn’t there? Edwards: What?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: There’s Ritter Partners and Banner Partners.Edwards: I’ve got two family partnerships. I guess Ritter Partners grew out of my SBIC,so when I ended the SBIC and that whole thing was ended it went into RitterPartners. And there the kids owned half and I owned half, and it was calledRitter Partners.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why Ritter?Edwards: I spent a lot of time as a child at a place called June Lake, which is on the eastside of the Sierras, just east of here.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I know it.Edwards: I spent a lot of time there; my parents had a cabin up there, so I was there alot. There’s some wonderful backcountry there. You can go up out of thevalley to June Lake, and then you get up into a bunch of lakes and Banner andRitter Peaks—they’re very tall peaks in the Sierras. And so I’ve named a lotof stuff that the family did after Carson and Banner and Ritter and a wholebunch of places there and mountains there. Banner Peak and Ritter Peak;they’re both tall granite peaks.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I know that country. I’m a backpacker.Edwards: It’s beautiful. Oh you do. Well, I’ve been back in that country a lot, a lot.Carson, Minaret—I’ve named a lot of things after those peaks back there.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Would you call those limited partnerships? What would those entities that youcreated be called?Edwards: They’re just family partnerships; they’re not limited partnerships. There areno limited partners. There are only partners there, and I’m the managingpartner.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see. And those still exist? 30Edwards: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: All right. Then is the next step Bryan and Edwards?Edwards: Yes. In 19—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Sixty-eight according to this note.Edwards: Yes, ’68, John and I had been doing ventures and we were spending more andmore time on ventures. We’d gone up to look at a company in Santa Rosacalled Optical Coating Laboratories, which is a little company up there in thislittle town, and it was isolated and they did some interesting stuff. And talkingto these guys, there wasn’t much in that town except Optical CoatingLaboratories [chuckling] that was interesting, and so they spent a lot of timetogether. They planned and worked on their own operation a lot, spent a lot oftime thinking about it. And as we drove home, it occurred to us that thatwould be really— I mean, why are we doing what we’re dong? We should bespending full time on venture capital. And it had a lot of advantages, so westarted Bryan and Edwards.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And what were the advantages?Edwards: Well, we were Bryan and Edwards, and we faced the world as Bryan andEdwards. It was a sort of an institutional-sounding thing with legs, longevity,you know. But Bryan and Edwards was really John and myself. And when aventure would come in we’d just cut it in two; John would take half and I’dtake half, and he’d take his half and he’d put it where he wanted to with hischildren and so forth, and my half I’d do the same. It’d go in thesepartnerships. And so the world looked at us as this bigger thing. It doubled thesize of our investing ability. So instead of investing x-thousand, we couldinvest 2x thousand. So that was the advantage. Another advantage was John’s a very bright, decent, fair, honest human being,and if I wanted to go on a trip or something I could leave and he’d bethoroughly familiar with everything I was doing. If I died he could take overmy estate and take care of it. And the same with John—if he wanted to travel,or died for any reason, I was there to help his wife and family with theirproblems because I was thoroughly familiar with them and he was thoroughlyfamiliar with them. And that was a big advantage. And so we formed thiscompany. It was really just a partnership but it faced the world as a seriousentity. And that’s why. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were you unique in having that form of organization?Edwards: Yes, I think so. It just happened to be two people that were doing the samething.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But everybody else that we’ve mentioned, they end up in limited partnerships,do they not?Edwards: Yes. They do. The limited partners have no liability and they’re not liable foranything. They can’t get any more money out of a limited partner than he’salready put in, and if anybody gets sued, it’s not going to be the limitedpartner because he wasn’t involved in whatever happened that was not good.And so it’s a good form for venture capital because all these people that put inlots of money. Nowadays it’s mostly pension funds and institutions putting inthe really big money. They’re clean and so they’re the limited partners. Thegeneral partners are the ones that run the company, take the responsibility, andso forth, and also put in some money and get 20 percent, 30 percent of theprofit that comes out of it. And it works well for both sides.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So in essence, my simplistic way of looking at it, you and John Bryan wereacting as general partners; you just didn’t have a limited partnership.Edwards: Right. We were general partners. There was no limited group behind us. Andwe thought about that.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: The obvious question is, what about the liability? You have the advantage ofmaking your own decisions and going away on vacation when you want to,but you also have the weight if anything goes wrong there’s nowhere else togo but you.Edwards: Yes, it’s our fault but it’s our money. [chuckling] So who’s to complain? Ourchildren?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So none of that deterred you.Edwards: No, no. We didn’t ever do anything that was illegal or—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh no, I’m not meaning that, but venture capital can go bad! Not everycompany is going to be a success. Edwards: Oh yes, tell me about it!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] Well, I want to hear about the non-successes.Edwards: Venture capital is a risky business, and the majority of your investments willfail. They’ll either totally go bust or they’ll be big disappointments and they’llnever amount to much of anything. They’ll just be a nuisance and take upyour time and effort, and so forth. The winners, or the ones that don’t takemuch time, they’ve got very good managements and that’s why they’rewinners.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, well how did you deal psychologically with that?Edwards: With what?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, the idea that John and I are going to put money into x.Edwards: Well, we didn’t have to do it together. If John wanted to do something and Ididn’t want to do it, he did it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Okay, well, you alone. What goes on in your mind when you’re thinking thatthis could be a booming success and it could be a booming failure.Edwards: That’s always in your mind. It’s risky, risky, very risky.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Does that worry you?Edwards: No! Well, the mathematics of venture capital is this. All you can lose is whatyou put into it. Right?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [tentatively] Yes.Edwards: So that’s it. One time. 1x is what you put into it. If it’s successful, it can go1000x! One 1000x will offset a thousand bad ones.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Okay, so that’s what you’re thinking. Edwards: Oh yes. It’s exactly like drilling oil wells. One out of twenty wildcats willproduce oil and produce a lot of oil. And nineteen of them will producenothing. The only way you can find oil is to drill down and find out if it’sthere. You might have reasons for thinking it might be there. But a lot of thetime when you drill a wildcat oil well, you get nothing, zip, total loss; thesame with venture capital. You’ve got to have enough money to do multipleventures, and use some sense in doing them, and it works out beautifully. Idon’t even think about the losses. So what’s another loss?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But it does seem to me that this is a direct correlation with where you’ve comefrom.Edwards: Yes, it might be.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Might? [chuckling]Edwards: [chuckling] That’s it! That’s it. Yes, sure. [Venture capital] is the same as theoil business.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because a lot of people would just not be able to do that.Edwards: Well, I’ve done hundreds of ventures, and the majority of them eitherbottomed out totally or didn’t amount to anything. Very few of them, 20percent of them or so, were very comfortably successful, and some of themwere outstandingly successful.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And that’s all you need. That’s what you’re saying.Edwards: Oh that’s more than enough, more than enough. But you’ve got to realize thatyou’re going to make a lot of mistakes, and you’re going to fail most of thetime.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: When you began this side investing—you had a job-job, which presumablywas paying you decently—but were you thinking of your family and saying toyourself, I can only put so much into venture investment because I’m notgoing to risk the—what’s the term?Edwards: The corpus, risk the assets, risk the fortune. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes.Edwards: It’s always in the back of your mind, but I didn’t ever take those huge riskseither. I didn’t ever take all of my chips and put them in on one bet. I alwayshad some left over. The guy that did it was Reid.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did he?Edwards: Yes. He did it twice. He was an electrical engineer, and he was working as ananalyst with Fireman’s Fund. He went down to Ampex, which was an earlycompany on Silicon Valley. In fact, they developed videotape recorders, andhe was able to talk to the guys on the benches: what are you doing, and whatall this means, and so forth. He was able to understand what they were talkingabout. And he sort of mortgaged his house and got his mother to mortgage herhouse, and he put all this money in.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] Oh he didn’t tell me that!Edwards: And I think he made $1 million out of it or something like that! It was huge!Then he was talking to an engineer out of Varian—was it Varian? Varian wasdoing something called ionic vacuum pumps, very obscure, you don’t want toknow—ionic vacuum. But it was a vacuum pump that could pump a vacuumdown as close to outer space as you can get. You get almost every last particleout of this void, and they did it by having a current flowing from a cathode toan anode and then plastering the stuff in there against the wall. And it wasbeing used at places like SLAC—the Stanford Linear Accelerator [Center].They’d pump that tube down with as little substance, as little—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Almost a vacuum.Edwards: --[not?] anything in there. They’d do it with ionic vacuum pumps, so it’s usedfor things like that. If you want to get close to outer space, you use the ionic—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I wonder if it was around when Ernest Lawrence was building his cyclotron?Edwards: Well, the cyclotron had to be totally a vacuum.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I had never thought about how they did that. Edwards: And you could pump it down, way down, with mechanical pumps, but it’snever really as clean as you can get it with an ionic vacuum.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: When you’re trying to study atomic particles, you are going to have bigproblems.Edwards: Yes, that’s what they were doing. If there’s anything in the way, that foulsthings up.So Reid started this company with the money he had out of Ampex, and itdidn’t go very well! [chuckling] It was not earning a lot of money; it wasgrowing pretty rapidly, but let’s say it was growing 30 percent a year, and itwas earning 3 percent on its assets, so it’s in trouble. You’ve got to bringmore money in from the outside. So John and I went in to give him a handthere, and we helped to finance it, and then he, fortunately, sold it toPerkinElmer before it went broke. [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: As I remember, he had first cut his teeth—and you correct me because youknow the story better than I—by investing for Fireman’s Fund. So presumablyhe’d learned the ropes.Edwards: Yes, he did some investing for Fireman’s Fund. He invested in a—what thehell’s the name of that company. It was a company that could read numbersand letters and things—electronically, down in Dallas.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, Bill Draper talked about that too. I can’t remember the name of thatcompany. [Recognition Equipment].Mr. Dennis also had a fairly tolerant boss at Fireman’s Fund, who when hesaw that Reid was making money for the company, let him go do his thing.All I’m trying to clarify is Reid just didn’t all of a sudden start out of the blueinvesting his own personal fortune without some background in investing.Edwards: Yes he was—right. Well, he had more background than we had! So Reidpushed it all in twice; I don’t think he’d ever do that again. He took all of hischips and put it in Ampex, and then all of his chips and put them into Ultech.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now I’m presuming that you didn’t, as you put it, help him out solely becausehe was a friend.Edwards: No. We hoped to make money out of it. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And so you saw that this deal had potential.Edwards: Yes, it looked like it had potential.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, and it did.Edwards: Yes, well, I hope PerkinElmer made money out of it. [laughter] It’s a verylegitimate science. It’s wonderful and necessary.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, where are we now?Edwards: I guess we’ve started Bryan and Edwards.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Bryan Edwards, yes.Edwards: In ’68. In those early days, other people had all the money from these limitedpartnerships, most of the other people. I think Art Rock had substantialbacking, although he didn’t have a normal limited partnership.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What about Pitch?Edwards: Pitch went out and raised money, and he started a company called AssetManagement Company. He raised a limited partnership, several of them. Johnand I didn’t do that. So we couldn’t replenish our funds. So when we startedout early on, we were making investments, each of us, sort of in the $10,000,$20,000 level each. And so they were $20,000 to $40,000 together.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now is that a very small investment for the period?Edwards: Very small. In those days there were much smaller investments. In the earlydays you could build a semiconductor fabricating facility, the whole thing,you could make semiconductors with all the equipment, and so forth, start acompany, for a couple of million dollars in the early days, the very early days.Now, just to build a fabrication plant might cost a couple of billion dollars. Soin those days it was cheaper to do ventures; they were not as big andambitious as they do now.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And so the amounts that you tended to invest were par for the period? Edwards: We just grew, so we grew from—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But you weren’t under-investing compared to your peers?Edwards: Oh no, no. We didn’t have the money that the limited partnerships [had]—nowhere close. And gradually, we were sort of out of the mainstream. In thesixties we were in the mainstream; in the early seventies we were sort of beingphased out because more of them were coming in with limited partnershipsthey were forming. And so we became less significant. We had a lot of friendsin the business, and so we had a lot of contacts, and so forth, which wereuseful, but we didn’t have the money to compete with that group.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So what did you do about that?Edwards: Well, we kept getting more and more money. So by ’83 or something, weweren’t making $10,000 or $20,000 investments; we were making $200,000to $600,000 investments just by making the money and paying our taxes andhaving more money to invest.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But also establishing a strong track record so that you could go out and buy—Edwards: We didn’t ever do it. We thought about it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So where was the money coming from?Edwards: Just from us.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Generated by your investment.Edwards: Just selling successful investments.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh I see.Edwards: And they had grown over the years.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So you never had to deal with outsiders. Edwards: Never dealt with outsiders. And I’m sure we’d be a good deal richer today ifwe had had more backing, but we didn’t. But, and I know, we’re comfortable.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You’re rich enough. [chuckling]Edwards: In fact, we’re quite comfortable.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You wanted to have independence and flexibility. I’m imagining that that’svery difficult to have if you’re obligated to all these limited partners.Edwards: Well, if you’re going to go that way, you need to build an organization, andyou need to shoulder all the people problems you’ll have building anorganization. You’ve got to pay attention because your name is on the door,and people are putting large amounts of money into your care, and so forth,and that’s a heavy responsibility, and you should be thinking about it. So wewent one way, everybody else went some other way, but we’ve doneextremely well.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you ever have second thoughts?Edwards: No. No. We thought it over; we thought it over. And at one point in the, Idon’t know, in the late seventies or early eighties, we considered—I think itmust have been in the late seventies—we considered trying to put together aventure fund that would be foreign-owned, so that the majority of theownership would be people that were not citizens of the United States. Youcould take a foreign-owned company and put it in a tax haven, and then it’s aforeign-domiciled, foreign-owned company, and the United States really hasnothing to do with it. And up until 1986, that form existed. Then the UnitedStates said you can’t do that anymore; you’ve got to declare that income.Before that, you could just let it compound. We were in an investment in theNetherlands Antilles. It was run out of New York; it was an investment group,run out of New York, majority foreign-owned. They were incorporated in theNetherlands Antilles and they paid 2 percent a year taxes, or something, alittle bit in the Netherlands Antilles, but the U.S. government had no controlover a foreign-owned company, foreign-domiciled. So that was that. That’sthe way you ran it. We considered it and decided not to do it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why? Edwards: Didn’t want the trouble and then didn’t necessarily— We were notcomfortable with the people that might invest in it, and the kind of problems itmight bring us, and so we wouldn’t have friends investing, and so forth.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It seems to me, compared to everything else you’ve done, a little devious.Edwards: What?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That it’s a way of making money without paying taxes to the United Statesgovernment.Edwards: It’s not devious because it was legal.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I know.Edwards: It was absolutely legal, and then in 1986 the government made it not legal andthen it wasn’t legal.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But look at all the investigations that are going on right now; the people whohave Swiss bank accounts and holdings in the Caribbean.Edwards: This would have been done right out in the open, absolutely open, absolutelyopen and totally within the law.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh I’m not implying that you would ever do anything illegal.Edwards: No, it wasn’t illegal, [chuckling] but we considered it and didn’t do it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why did the U.S. government decided to stop that?Edwards: It wasn’t for SBICs or venture companies—it was for all kind of companies.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh I know that.Edwards: Any foreign-domiciled, foreign-controlled corporation was not subject toUnited States law. Period. But U.S. citizens are subject to United States law, 40so in ’86 they said any U.S. citizen involved in one of these things has toreport that income as if it were coming to them. And that was the end of it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I’ll bet it was.Edwards: But it was 100 percent legal. We never would have done anything that wasillegal.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I don’t want you to think that I was ever implying that you would considerdoing anything illegal, because that wasn’t in my mind. But I am thinkingabout it in the context of what’s going on in the news today.Edwards: Well, I think people that take money, spirit it out of the country, put it in aSwiss bank account and let it accumulate tax free, are terrible. They arebreaking the law every inch of the way and they should be apprehended. Ithink they will open these Swiss banks and find out what’s going on, andanybody that’s been doing that is going to be in a severe problem, and I hopethey get them.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, it’s almost noon. Should we stop for today?Edwards: As you wish.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And then pick up again? Because I do want to talk to you about where to gonext. So maybe we’ll just stop taping here?Norton: I have a question.Edwards: Fire!Norton: I can’t resist asking, what did you think of the movie, There Will Be Blood?Did you see it?Edwards: I did. He was a very bad man! And you’re going to find bad men, bad peopleeverywhere. But that man was sick. I did see the movie and I thought it was avery powerful movie. Who was the guy that played the—Norton: Daniel Day Lewis. Edwards: Daniel Day Lewis was brilliant, absolutely brilliant.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: For someone who didn’t see it—who was he playing?Edwards: He didn’t play anybody in particular; he played a wildcatter, a guy that wasout in the mining business trying to make money out of a mine. He got intothe oil business and he was a very devious, very dishonest person, and mean.He had no friends; he had no people skills. He was avaricious and that was all,and he ended up making a lot of money in the oil business. He did it bytrickery and dishonesty, and so forth.Norton: Yes, you’ve mentioned your interest in religion, and that kind of Americanreligion was also a factor in that movie.Edwards: Well, yes. I am a religious person but not in any religion that exists on earth.We don’t know who God is or what God is. In fact, I wrote a little book abouttwo years ago called The Evolution of Religion.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh did you!Edwards: I’ll give you a copy if you’d like it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I’d like it.Edwards: It’s not going to get any awards, but it’s my thinking on that very subject.Norton: Well, thank you for letting me ask that question.Edwards: You can ask any questions you’d like to, Linda.Norton: I’ll turn this off now.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It is June 2, 2009 and this is the second interview with Mr. Edwards. We arein his home, his very attractive home, in Atherton. Last time, we got up to Bryan and Edwards. I thought what we could discuss today is the basics ofhow you go about venture capital. Maybe the best way to talk about it is tohave you go through what kind of questions you ask when somebody comesto you with a business plan or a proposal, then what? What do you do?Edwards: Well, the two most important things you look for are a competentmanagement team. Really, you’d like to have more than just a guy with theidea, although frequently you’ll back somebody with just his idea. Buteventually you want to see a team; you want to see the marketing and thefinance and the research and development, and all that, in one place. So that’sthe beginning. The people are the most important thing. And then the nextmost important thing is that the people are trying to do something that’ssignificant. If they’re going into an area where there’s terrific competition orwhere your competition is very difficult, it’s less attractive than if they’regoing into an area where they’re creating a new market or building a newindustry where there isn’t that much competition and they get there early.Those are the most important factors in selecting an investment.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But if they’re going into a new area, I would think that would also meanunknown risks.Edwards: Absolutely—but unknown potential.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] The glass is always half full.Edwards: Amgen was started by Bill Bowes, who is a venture capitalist. He had the ideaearly in the biotech era of bringing together some very, very capable peopleand the very best technicians in the country. He inquired around about whoare these people. He was turned down by somebody at Berkeley, I think. Andhe asked that person,“Who else should I go see?” And they mentioned someprofessors at Caltech. He went down and interested them, and he broughttogether a group of advisors, and he put together a company, and he createdAmgen, which was a multi-billion dollar company in a huge new industry andit was really, I think, the largest and most successful company in that area,still going—in a competitive area but I think they’ll be fine.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you have any connection with Amgen?Edwards: Well, I was an investor at the beginning. Bill is a friend of mine and so I hadthe opportunity to put money into Amgen, and it worked out extremely well.It went hundreds of times. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was it Bowes that sold you on the idea?Edwards: Well, Bill Bowes is a very dear old friend of mine, and he’s extremely brightand has great judgment. It wasn’t hard to sell me.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You didn’t feel that you had to go out and do some investigating on yourown?Edwards: Well, I was interested in what he had done and who he had chosen and whatthey planned to do. Their original plan had to do more with veterinary sorts ofthings, at least that was part of their original plan, because they’re not sodifficult to get approved by the FDA. But they went off, and they went intodifferent ways; ways that they didn’t anticipate getting done.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, that was certainly a good example of a revolutionary technology.Edwards: Right, and it was off in a market by itself and it did extremely well, is doingextremely well. And there are always problems, but it’s fine.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, to my comment about risk, you immediately said yes, but potential.Edwards: Yes, well, they go together. Terrific risk and the potential.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How do you handle the risk part of it? I mean as a person.Edwards: Well, the majority of venture investments that I’ve made, and I’ve made a lotof them, have not worked out the way that the original plan was. They havenot been as successful. Sometimes they’ve been a total bomb and wentbankrupt; you got nothing back. Sometimes they struggled along, and theybecame part of the walking dead, and they went on for years and years butdidn’t die. And most of the investments that I’ve made have done one of thosetwo things. Some of them, though, have been big winners, and they have beensubstantial winners, and those are the ones that make it worthwhile.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What do you do about the walking dead? Is there any way that you can killthem off? [chuckling]Edwards: You sell your interest in it or you wait until they die or someone buys them.More likely, someone’s going to buy them eventually and you can get your money back and make some money on them, but it won’t be significant. It’snot enough money to make up for the losers.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, in your mention of the importance of the team—that seems to me tolead into a question about people skills and how you assess people. Is that abig part of venture capital?Edwards: Absolutely. And that’s a difficult, imprecise art, but you just have to developjudgment, and then people leave a wake in their lives. They don’t go throughlife unseen and unheard, so you can check on them a bit. But I’ve invested insome people that were—they were mental problems. They were really odd![chuckling] I could mention a few of them, but you know—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you know that from the start?Edwards: Oh no. I was totally surprised. We had a person in who was a crook! How doyou protect yourself? You really can’t. He wasn’t a known crook until he wasknown to us, but after he failed, and we dismissed him from this company, hewent back to Carnegie-Mellon on the East Coast and started again. He left hisreputation in Oregon, and nobody checked back on him with us to find outwhat sort of a person he was, but basically he was dishonest.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That is a lesson in the important of due diligence, is it not?Edwards: Oh yes. But how do you check on somebody who’s never been apprehendedand doing something criminal?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, that’s a problem. But it seems to me the people who followed you letthe ball drop in not talking to you.Edwards: They could have talked to us. All they had to do is ask him where he’d beenthe last ten years or five years, and if he’d told them they could come backand see us. But he probably laid down a good enough smokescreen so theydidn’t do it.I once invested in a pair of PhDs; very, very well trained but they were sosecretive about what they were doing that they wouldn’t talk to customers![chuckling] They wouldn’t explain to the customers all the technology thatthey had because they didn’t want to— I’ve run into people like that that werenutty about whatever they were doing and how important they thought it was.So you find strange people, but you can’t measure those people, really, beforeyou invest. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because you’ve been an investor, and you presumably are sitting on theirboard, right? You would think that you would add quite a bit of clout.Edwards: That’s later. [chuckling] By the time you’re on the board, you have made theinvestment. And then you struggle with these people that are a little odd. Sothat’s part of the risk.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So part of the oddness is then, not listening or at least following through onthe advice that you’re giving?Edwards: Well, I wouldn’t say that my advice is always that good. But if it’s a businessthey’ve started, then they understand. I’m dependent on their advice in manycases more than they’re dependent on mine. But if they go way offline andhead off in the wrong direction, I might be able to say, “You mustn’t do that.”<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You presumably come into this enterprise with a general knowledge abouthow businesses should develop.Edwards: Yes, right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And they presumably don’t have that same kind of expertise.Edwards: Right, most often. Most often, or many times. I won’t say most often, butmany times they don’t have that experience. But—they have healthy egos andthey’re bright as hell and they— I see somebody approaching my front door.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you need to do something?Edwards: I’m going to have to. My housekeeper’s not in. [brief interruption inrecording] Back to work.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Can you say something about the dynamics of being on a board of directors?Or is that way too general a question?Edwards: Well, I could talk about it. [chuckling] Boards vary all over the place.Sometimes you have somebody on the board that has a very difficultpersonality and you have to deal with them or get rid of them. And sometimesyou have boards where there’s a certain bias along one way or another. Youhave to work with them, but it’s very difficult to generalize about that. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I bet.Edwards: That’s just all the dynamics of a group of people together that are not usuallytogether, and you have to work your way through it with some people skills.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you find, in general, that people listen to your advice?Edwards: Sometimes. But generally, you know, you’re working together. It isn’t as ifyou’re working opposed to each other, and the advice is flowing all the time.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see. So it’s more collaboration.Edwards: Yes, it’s collaboration. I wouldn’t know how to run one of these businesses,really. I’m not a technician in that sense. I could do it briefly, but I wouldn’tbe successful at it long-term.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I’m presuming that you’re not an expert in the technology—assumingthat it’s is a technology-based company we’re talking about.Edwards: That’s true, that’s true. I have a background in technology, and I have thevocabulary—most of it anyway—and I can learn what I don’t have, but I’mnot an expert.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, so that doesn’t pose a barrier. You’re not going to say, “Well, I’m notgoing to invest in biotechnology because I don’t really have a basis in it.”Edwards: Yes, but you could. You know, I was there at the beginning. There wasnobody there to teach anybody how to be a venture capitalist. We were not atspecialized. We did everything. Anything that came along that lookedinteresting we would do, whether it was in publishing or finance ortechnology or whatever. We invested in farming and all kind of things. Andnowadays there’s more expertise, frequently, in a venture group. They’llspecialize in medical things, or they’ll specialize in communication or insoftware or something. They’ll have a lot more expertise in the venture capitalgroup. But we did everything; if it looked interesting and looked like it couldsucceed, we did it. And if I were starting out again, I would make fewermistakes. [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, we can all say that! Edwards: But in the early days there were a handful of venture capital organizations inthe nation, and most of them were on the East Coast. There was nobody thathad been in this business for very long out here, and so we just did it andlearned by doing—and making a lot of mistakes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, but a lot of big hits too.Edwards: Yes. Well, that’s the wonderful thing about it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How do you feel about the current tendency toward specialization?Edwards: It makes a lot of sense.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Does it?Edwards: Oh sure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So venture capitalist does really have a pretty good take on what thetechnology is.Edwards: Absolutely, right. Yes, it does make a lot of sense, and they’re better at ittoday. One, they have someone to teach them, and two, they’ve got the depthand the technology that they need. So it’s settled out the way it tis. It’s beenrationalized, much rationalized from where it was when we started.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Getting back to the subject of boards. I can remember when I was talking withGib Myers—Edwards: By the way, Gib lives right over there. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That’s why it’s so familiar. We felt we’d been here before.Edwards: You’d been on the street before.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, anyway, Gib Myers, in an off-the-cuff remark said something to theeffect when Bill Edwards, way back, was sitting on multiple boards, peoplesaid to each other, “How can he do all that?” Edwards: Well, you do the best you can! That’s how you do it, that’s how you do it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But my impression was that he meant that it wasn’t common in those days.Edwards: Oh no, it was common. Everybody did it.You had to do your part, and nobodycould sit on all of the boards in which they had an interest, and so somebodyis sitting on them representing you. So sometimes they depended on me tolook after things.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And is it usually the major investor that is the board member?Edwards: Yes, frequently. But in the early days we didn’t have many major investors.[chuckling] We needed each other just to be able to put together aninvestment. That first investment in Acurex—it was called Aerothermoriginally—was about $100,000. Well, it took several of us to do $100,000.Very few venture capitalists want to risk everything on one investment. ReidDennis did it twice. And he’ll never do it again, I don’t think.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That implies that you had quite a network. You hear about a business proposalthat you think is worth looking at, and then you pick up the phone and callPitch?Edwards: In those days it was very collegial. It isn’t anymore because the funds haveenough money now, frequently, they can do it straight up. They can do it allby themselves, and they do.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But what about the risk of that approach?Edwards: Well, let’s say you’ve got a fund with $500 million or a billion dollars in it,and you’re making an investment for a few tens of millions. That’s not thatbig an investment. You could lose it and it doesn’t hurt you much. It’s amatter of balance.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Does that mean that there’s now a lot of secrecy?Edwards: There’s a great deal more secrecy, a great deal more privacy now than therewas. Initially, why we would get together occasionally—the WesternAssociation of Venture Capitalists, or WASBIC, the Western Association ofSmall Business Investment Companies, which was its original name beforethere were many of these partnerships. And then in the late sixties, the partnerships started coming along, and we changed it to Western Associationof Venture Capitalists because it was no longer all SBICs.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But in the original group, all those members were people that today we wouldcall venture capitalists?Edwards: Yes. They all had SBICs; they started as Small Business InvestmentCompanies. Yes, but they weren’t called venture capitalists. In those days theywere called private capitalists.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Or what is it that Pitch was talking about—special situations.Edwards: [chuckling] Yes. Everything was a special situation.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Special, which could mean anything if you bandied that term around.Edwards: That’s right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You know we were talking off tape about the New York Times article I gave Talk to me about how youwould use a business plan and where it would get you.Edwards: They are useful because if somebody comes in with a business plan that’sabsolutely kooky, well, you don’t spend much time on it. It’s a reflection ofthe way they think, and you’re just not interested. So the business plan has tomake some sense; it can’t be crazy or it reflects on its originator. So they areuseful in that respect. But the world is changing rapidly all the time, and youhave to adjust to the change that takes place, and if you’ve made an error inyour original plan, you’ve got to be able to change it and go a differentdirection. But business plans never have been any more valuable than that;they don’t do what they say they’re going to do, frequently.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Does that mean that one of the things that you might be trying to assess whenyou’re sizing up an entrepreneur is how flexible he or she might be?Edwards: Sure, yes. Brent Bowers, “Investors Pay Business Plans Little Heed, Study Finds,” NYT, May 14, 2009. 50<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is he rigidly going to stick to this business plan?Edwards: That would certainly be a demerit, if the guy doesn’t have flexibility.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What other qualities spring to mind in an entrepreneur—things that you wouldsay, “Okay, this guy sounds interesting to me.”Edwards: Well, I think, to the degree that you can have it measured—brain power! Justintellectual firepower is really important. If you can find that, that’s certainlyan important thing. Also, to have someone that’s done it before, somebodythat’s been around once, either in the same business or some similarbusiness—he’s done it once—that is a big plus, because he’s made all thosemistakes and he won’t make them again.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And hopefully learned by them.Edwards: Yes, and hopefully won’t make them again.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So would you be a little distrustful of a graduate student coming to you withan idea from Stanford or Berkeley or wherever who had never been out in thebusiness world?Edwards: You’d have reservations about his ability to execute, and very frequently, theentrepreneur is incapable of taking the company into greater sizes. You haveto shunt him aside, deal with him, work with him, and he’ll frequently realizethat he’s over his head. So you can counsel, but just because you’re comingout of school, why an awful lot of great investments have started withsomeone coming out of Stanford—Google and others, fresh out of school.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, exactly.Edwards: So you don’t want to turn them away. You look at their idea.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But you try to lead them down a path that will make for a good company.Edwards: Yes, and as they put together a management team, you try to guide them intogood people that do the various functions. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, maybe it’s a cliché that venture capitalists are not only looking forgetting a sizable return on their investment, but building a company is animportant part of it.Edwards: Oh absolutely! And if you want to have a big success, you’ve built acompany, a big company.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And does this newer generation of venture capitalists also feel that way?Edwards: I’m so far out of touch with the newer generation of venture capitalists. I’msure they do; you just have to.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Aside from the specialization that you talked about as happening since you,the founders, came onto the scene, are there other big changes in the wayventure capital is done nowadays compared to how you founding fathers didit?Edwards: Well, that article I gave you suggests some major changes have taken place.Options have always been an important thing in the venture capital arena,because frequently you don’t have the money to pay people big salaries, andthe thing that attracts the very best people is to own part of [the company], andif you give them options, they can own part of it and it doesn’t cost you anycash at the moment. [technical interruption] So things like that, the very things—the FinancialAccounting Standards Board [FASB] getting stricter and stricter and stricterand reducing the kind of flexibility that you have in accounting. All sorts ofthings of that sort happened—taxes and one thing and another, and you’ve gotto adjust to it, but those adjustments probably can’t be made. They’re makingit too hard, the federal government is, because they’re not bright enough toknow what they’re doing. They’re dealing with a delicate thing out here inSilicon Valley, and they’re doing it in extremely clumsy fashion.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What is their objective? What are they trying to accomplish?Edwards: Just what they always try to do; they want to govern, they want to control,they want to get reelected, mostly. That’s the thing that drives the politicians. Michael S. Malone, “Washington Is Killing Silicon Valley,” Wall Street Journal, December 22, 2008, p. A19. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is this an offshoot of the recession and the idea that financial markets, ingeneral, need to be more heavily regulated?Edwards: That would be part of it. The more they regulate the venture business, themore difficult it gets to be, and basically, they’re killing the goose that lays thegolden egg. It’s never done any damage. The Microsofts, and the Ciscos, andthe Amgens, and so forth, are fabulous companies. I was on the board of Trust Company of the West for many years, which is acompany we were involved in starting, founding, and it grew to have $100billion under management. On the board, we had all sorts of reports that cameto us, including what we had invested in, the major investments, the biggestinvestments we’d made and the top ten investments. You know, there wouldbe three or four ventures, and these would be companies that had just beenstarted within the last twenty or thirty years, and here they were, hugeinvestments! Well, if they keep squeezing the venture business, that won’thappen anymore. It’ll go away; they’ll kill it. Because they don’t even knowwhat they’re dealing with.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Right. I know from reading your CV that you have been at the top of two ofthe major venture capital organizations, the Western [Association of VentureCapitalists] and the National [Venture Capital Association]. It leads me towonder what role these two organizations are having nowadays to try toreverse what they think is the wrong tactics of the government.Edwards: The national association was set up to give the venture industry a way ofdealing with Washington.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is that so.Edwards: The western association was set up before the national association, a numberof years, and it was set up by just a group of western venture capitalistswanting to be together and share ideas and share investments. So the nationalassociation is aimed more at regulation of the venture business.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see. And would you say that the western is more a social organization then,rather than a lobby?Edwards: Well, no, we meet almost monthly, I guess, during the winter, and we havespeakers. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: This is the western.Edwards: And that’s the time that the guys can get together and talk about their mutualproblems and share ideas. So it is—you say social; business/social, I’d say.And a lot of friends, good friends.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And deals consummated there?Edwards: I suppose [chuckling] that it works toward that. But as I say, there’s not thatmuch sharing that goes on much anymore. Sharing is the currency of thebusiness, and if company A shares ideas with companies B and C, thencompany A expects to have B and C share ideas with them. So that’s acurrency, sharing.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Lobbying then would be considered one of the major raison d’être for thenational association?Edwards: Of the National Venture Capital Association.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And what kind of inroads over the years has it had in shaping federal policy?Edwards: Phew. It’s tough. I don’t know how much—you know, I’ve been out of thatfor a while.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, maybe speak to the time when you held office. I can give you the yearsbecause it’s right here on your CV. Let’s start with the National VentureCapital Association; you were director from 1981 through 1986. Can youthink back to any particular issues that you were dealing with at that time?Edwards: One of the issues that we were most interested in those days was the capitalgains tax. And there was a representative from California [actually Wisconsin]named [William A.] Steiger who proposed and got through Congress areduction of the capital gains tax [Steiger Amendment of 1978], and he got itreduced all the way, with the help of Reagan, to 20 percent. That makes ahuge difference.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What had it been? Much higher? Edwards: It had been 28 [percent] and then 36 [percent]. I don’t know. It moves around,but they got it down to 20 [percent]. It’s still in that area, and it’s been a hugebenefit to the venture business because we make all of our money with capitalgains. You take the profit out of it, and the venture capitalists go away, theentrepreneurs go away, and everything else goes away. So that was a veryimportant thing, and that’s something that we worked hard on to get done.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I think it was Pitch who was talking about legislation, I think it was in 1978,allowing pension funds to invest.Edwards: To invest—a huge source of revenue for the venture business, yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now did some of these changes at the federal level come about because thenational association was lobbying?Edwards: That’s a hard question. Things like that happen because lots of people dosomething, and to say it was because of the national association, I don’t knowthat we could do that, but we could certainly say they helped a lot. Theypushed in the right direction when they had something to push on.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you, as director, actually talk to congresspeople? Was it at that level?Edwards: I went back once to talk to one of the leading congressmen, flew back toWashington, and we actually paid for the privilege of seeing him.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Paid?Edwards: Paid. And this was a Republican leader of Congress.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Paid in what way?Edwards: Cash.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You’re kidding!Edwards: Yes, I made a donation to his campaign fund. It was suggested to us it wouldbe the right thing to do, and of course we did it. Then we got on an airplane to fly back, and we were to have a meeting with him. The meeting never tookplace; we talked to one of his assistants.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You should have asked for your money back! [chuckling] Did that surpriseyou?Edwards: Yes it did, and it really irritated me too. It really irritated me.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, I can imagine. Here’s your elected official, and you have to pay to get inthe door.Edwards: Anyway, that was just incredible. I’ve never done that again.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So it sounds to me as though the National Venture Capital Association wasworking behind the scenes. It wasn’t as though you had a lobbyist right therein Washington. Or am I wrong about that?Edwards: You know I can’t say whether—we’ve probably hired lobbyists to do onething or another, but I don’t know of specific occasions.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What more to say about the National Venture Capital Association?Edwards: It’s a very good organization that’s tried to protect venture capital. But if youread that article I gave you, we haven’t been very successful, becausebasically the federal government has found a way to strangle us. And thenoose is tightening, and our effectiveness is— That article points out thatthere were between 200 and 300 IPOs every year leading up to SarbanesOxley, and then the first year after Sarbanes-Oxley or maybe second year,2008, there were six.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Really!Edwards: Six IPOs in the United States.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You can divorce that from the current recession, can’t you?Edwards: Oh absolutely. That was strictly Sarbanes-Oxley and the market, but that’swhat’s happened. They’ve found a way to strangle the industry, and they’ll get it strangled, and it’ll be gone, and then the goose that lays the golden egg willbe dead.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, what is happening to the venture capital industry? The way I’m hearingit, it’s being strangled at the Washington level and then you have thispervasive recession on top of it all.Edwards: That’s tough, but that goes away. I was in— The worst recession in recentyears, before this one, was a period in 1972 to 1978 or so, and for us it startedin about 1970 with the IPO market going away.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You were barely getting off the ground, weren’t you, in 1968.Edwards: Well, we’d been around for quite a while then.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I’m thinking of the partnership.Edwards: So anyway, that was a long period where there were no IPOs. It was whenthey had stagflation; Carter was president. And so we had inflation, a lot ofinflation, 12 percent or something, and no growth. It was the worst of all andit was a long period of time. We got through it and—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How did you get through it?Edwards: Well, Reagan came in and they got—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, yes, but that’s not till 1980.Edwards: Well, they got control of inflation and got the economy going properly again.Carter had basically said the nation’s had it and our best days are over, andReagan changed the attitude. So in answer to the question, yes, [the economy]comes back and this will come back. I don’t know how well it’ll come back,but the more difficult they make it the less large the comeback will be.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: In that long period for much of the seventies that you’re talking about, howdid you stagger along? And did it make a difference that—?Edwards: It made a difference. It really made a difference. With us, it made a hugedifference because we made money to invest by selling old investments. There was a long period there where the IPO market was gone, and that source ofliquidity, of being able to turn over venture investments and take the moneyand reinvest it, went away. And so it had a major effect on us. Of course, Idon’t think it was much better for the partnerships, because they were justgetting going in 1970, and so it was a slow period for everybody.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But you were a partnership.Edwards: Well, I mean limited partnerships, where they go out and raise money fromother people.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Okay, I see.Edwards: We were a partnership, but I’m referring to the limited partnerships.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: At least you didn’t have what I would think would be the heavy responsibilityof other people’s money.Edwards: Right, that’s right. And that’s one of the reasons that we didn’t ever getinvolved with other people’s money. But in that period [telephone ringing] inthat period—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you need to get that?Edwards: Forget it. My family assets went down two thirds—a big loss.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What stage was your family at that point? Your children were young, werethey not? Did that cramp your style?Edwards: No, our style—we always lived well below where we could be. We alwayslived relatively modestly, and so it didn’t— I worried, but it turned around.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Several things you’ve said give me the impression, and I’ve gotten it fromother venture capitalists as well, that you’re basically optimistic people.Edwards: Oh, I think that’s right. We wouldn’t be in the business if we weren’t.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You’re talking about a number of recession years here. You’re talking what,five, six, seven years. Did you ever think— Edwards: Well, for us it was probably closer to seven or maybe eight.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you ever think, why have I done this?Edwards: No, I was enjoying it too much.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Really? Even when it wasn’t doing well.Edwards: But in 1972 I was back in New York, and I went into a gallery where theywere having a show with the work of Ben Shahn, who was a calligrapherand—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, and a cartoonist.Edwards: Well, yes, he did that a little bit. But anyway, the cover of the program theyhad in this gallery was a portrait by Shahn. He was holding his face like this,and he had this really worried look on his face. I took that cover and I put it ina frame and it hangs in my office because it reminds me of what I felt like in1972, and it was pretty glum, you know. And so I was worried. When I sawthat picture, I said, “That’s exactly the way I feel, and I don’t want to forgetthis.” And I haven’t.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] But you didn’t give up.Edwards: Oh no, no, no.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, well, tenacity as well.Edwards: Well, it’s paid off pretty well.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: All through that bad period, were you fairly confident that this was a cycleand there would be an upswing?Edwards: Yes, I’m sure I was. As crazy as it might seem, I was probably optimistic,because I am optimistic. Anyone that’s bet against this nation for any periodof years has been wrong, and I think it’s true today. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And maybe you have to have a bit of an historian’s eye, too, to see that therealways have been dips but there’ve always been—when we started out, and we’re still going, and we’re still a powerful,promising nation, despite all the stuff you read in the newspapers.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I think most Americans know it in their hearts.Edwards: I think they do; I think they really do. Even if they’re out of work, if they’velost their jobs, I think they haven’t lost their optimism.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, getting back to the business plan: were you being flooded by businessplans? How did that part of it work?Edwards: Well, with us we’ve had a different kind of a history because we never hadany outside money; we had only our own money. All during the sixties wewere very much on the front of the cutting-edge of venture capital. Starting inthe early seventies, when the big partnerships started to come together withsubstantial amounts of money available, and then they could go back to thetrough and get more money, and more money, and more money. They thentook over and they were the leading venture capitalists. We were wellconnected in the industry and we did all right, but we were not creating thegreat companies of recent years, because those have been done by the limitedpartnerships that have a lot of money. By the way, the ventures kept getting more expensive. I think I mentioned toyou last time, there was a time back in the sixties when you could start asemiconductor company, the whole thing including building a fabmillion. Now it’d cost $2 billion or more to build a fab, one fab. And so thegame has changed; it’s gotten to be a much bigger game. When Amgen wasstarted, as I recall, the original amount of money raised in the first effort toraise money for it was $20 million. Big money. That’s beyond our reach.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is there less and less role for you as a private investor in today’s world justbecause of what you’re saying? That it takes so much money?Edwards: For me there’s a lot less. [laughter] I’m eighty years old! And I’m not doingany ventures, no ventures. 60<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, I know! Well, for people like you.Edwards: No, I think there’s room. It’s not as much room as there was back in thesixties, but there’s always room for a venture capitalist picking up an idea,early, from some student. And so there’s room and they’re there.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How do you distinguish what you are doing from angel investing?Edwards: What we were doing when we were active? What we were doing?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes.Edwards: Well, we were basically angel investors but bigger—we had more moneythan— We were mainstream venture capital in the sixties.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And also you were helping to manage companies. That is not necessarily whatan angel investor is going to do. Is that true?Edwards: He’s going to be involved. To the degree he’s capable, he’ll be involved.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see, so an angel investor would sit on a board.Edwards: Sure, oh absolutely, and he’ll perform the whole—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So it is a thin line between what you were doing and what an angel investorwould do.Edwards: Absolutely. Angels are back there at the very bottom trying to pick thesethings up when nobody knows about them and when they’re just a dream; it’ssome guy with a briefcase.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Should we talk about one of these many companies that you have been activewith as a way of illustrating some of these principles? Or do you think we’vedone enough about the nuts and bolts of venture capital?Edwards: Oh there’s something to be learned everywhere, and every situation isdifferent and you could talk about any one of them. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is there one to discuss on that list you sent me? Presumably you picked outthose companies because they were stellar.Edwards: These were companies where I sat on the board. [chuckling] Well, you couldpick any one of them and talk about it, and it’d be quite distinct from everyother one. I made so many mistakes! I was chairman of Acurex. I was on the board from the time it was started in1966, I think it was. And we started out and we were a government contractor.We had a bunch of very, very bright PhD and master’s [degree]aerothermodynamicists, mostly out of Stanford. So we started a company thatwas in the defense contracting business, and they were doing very advancedresearch on reentry vehicles, nose cones, outer space thermodynamics andvery, very advanced. And everything was going very well; we were growing nicely and alongcomes the Vietnam War, and Lyndon Johnson becomes president. He didn’treally want to pay for the war, but he wanted to fight the war, and so he cutback everything he could cut back except guns and butter. And there goes ourbusiness! Because we were doing way out, cutting-edge research in thethermodynamics of outer space.So we decided, in our great wisdom, that we needed to have a foot in thecommercial business, and we bought a company—incidentally a company thatI had been involved in very early on called Illumitronics, and they made verymundane stuff. They made packaging equipment for the candy industry andthe food industry. And they made things like weigh price labelers; you couldrun steaks or something over this thing and it would label each steak with howmuch it weighed and what the price was, or you could have it on a canningline. It would make sure that the level of the food in each can was up to whereit should be. All kind of things but very mundane. And we thought we can goin there with our engineers and we can turn this into a fabulous company. Not!And we struggled with that thing! [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What went wrong?Edwards: Well, we just had no idea what we were getting into. This is a company thathad grown up with a bunch of guys out of a garage someplace, and they haddeveloped systems of inventory control and movement of pieces and parts andmanufacturing, all sorts of things. And they developed them just kind of out ofthe back of their head, and they were very kludged together, and we saw thisthing and said, “Oh well, those are ridiculous systems. We’ll do it the rightway. And so we decided to do it the right way and we changed everything and then nothing worked! [laughter] And so, anyway, and then we struggled withthat for years.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was that one of the living dead?Edwards: No, it wasn’t the living dead. I think it finally went about thirty times our coston the thing but it took a long time. I’m not even going to tell you how long ittook because I don’t want this in the long-term record that I was chairman of acompany that took that long to get to someplace. We made some mistakes buteach one of them is totally different.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes. Is there any pattern, though, about getting return on your money?Edwards: Well, you try to be in things where you can get a major return, because you’renot going to get a major return on a lot of them. And so the ones that you doget a major return on have to be big, so you’re always looking for 40 percent ayear return or something, to make up for the times you get 0 percent.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And what are you looking at? Obviously you’re looking at where the companyis, but I would think it would also be contingent on what the externaldynamics are, I mean what’s happening politically, et cetera.Edwards: All those things, but you want a market that’s big enough to be significant. It’sgot to be a market that’s got billions of dollars of possible revenue.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And did you feel it was largely your role, when you were the major investor,to say, “Okay guys, this is the time.”Edwards: I learned that gradually; I learned that gradually. Anyway, each one of thosethings [companies we invested in] on there is totally different. Software,communications—Hambrecht & Quist was an investment banking firm. TrustCompany of the West was a bank, a trust company. Western Atlas was in theoil business; they’re all different. Software, microwave communications,they’re all different. And that’d be the same if you went through all thecompanies I’ve been in; they’ve all been different, and I’ve been invested inupward of 200 or maybe 300.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Really, that many?Edwards: Over the many years, yes. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But would you say that there are some basic investment/business principlesthat apply across the board?Edwards: Well, if you want a big company, you’ve got to have a big market. That’scertainly one of them. If you want to have a good company, you’ve got tohave capable, bright, experienced managers all through the management.Those are very broad requirements. And then you get off into the varioustechnologies, and so forth; they’re all different, different markets.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I can imagine how that would keep you stimulated!Edwards: I would say, although we never really knew what we were doing, it’s beenreally fun and exciting, and every day has got new problems and newopportunities. So it’s been a great career. I started out in the oil business, andit would have been a wonderful career and it would have been fun and thereare a lot of similarities. But when I look back on that decision I made to leavethe oil business and go do something else—I’m happy with that and making itin Silicon Valley was just serendipity, I think. I happened to be in exactly theright place at the right time and then stuck with it. Those are the things that Idid—two were lucky and one had some intelligence in it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I’m glad you brought up Silicon Valley because I’d like to hear yourideas about how the sheer geography of this region has played into venturecapital.Edwards: Well, we talked about this before, I believe. It’s a blessed area. God was goodto the Arabs when he put all the oil under Saudi Arabia and Iran, but God wasgood to Silicon Valley when he put Stanford and Berkeley here, when the sunshines and the weather’s so fabulous. And we have a lovely city, SanFrancisco, a cultural place that’s an interesting city nearby. And then westarted to produce some—what turned out to be—entrepreneurs; Hewlett andPackard, the Varian brothers. Bill Shockley came in with semiconductors.Some of these early people. We had a professor at Stanford named Termanwho encouraged Hewlett and Packard. I don’t know about the Varians; hemay have had something to do with them. But it started to come together.There started to be something happening here. It was a nice place to live. And then, as the business expanded, the attorneys we needed knew how tostart companies and solve problems. The architects learned how to buildfactories and space, the builders learned how to build clean rooms. Thebankers learned that they could deal with these little companies and do verywell with them. And the venture capitalists were very important. The most important were the entrepreneurs, and I’d say second in importance would bethe venture capitalists. So we had all these things come together and they became a critical mass.And the engineers liked it here for all the reasons—the weather and all the restof it. But also, there were jobs here. And if they went someplace else—Denver, Boise, you name it—or Minneapolis, there wouldn’t be that manyjobs. And if they lost a job or got bored with a job or didn’t like their boss,they could go across the street and get an increase in salary and anotherinteresting job. And so the engineers liked it here, and this whole critical masshas gone forward. The government is trying to strangle it at the moment, butit’s still here. It’s an unusual place, just a wonderful confluence of talent andevents and meteorology and whatnot.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And hard to dissect one as being more important than the other.Edwards: Well, they’re all important and we needed them all, but some of them werecreated because of the need. Someone stepped forward and they said, “I canbuild that.”<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: There’s a lot been written about the Silicon Valley culture as an explanationfor why so much innovation has happened here.Edwards: Well, I think I might have mentioned this to you in our last conversation.Theculture aspect is very interesting. The people that came to the United States allpulled up stakes somewhere—Ireland, Germany, somewhere. And they cameto the United States so they had a certain something in their nature whichmade them willing to take a risk. Then they started moving west, and they’dpull up stakes on a farm in Connecticut, and they’d try to find a better farm inOhio or something, and then they kept moving west, west, west, alwayslooking for something better, a better situation for their families, and so forth.So by the time they got to California, they were a pretty rarified bunch ofpeople. They’d had generations of people who were willing to take a risk andmove on. So California was populated by these people that came from— My mothercame from Minnesota, my father came from Louisiana, they came toCalifornia for some reason, and they got here—a whole state full of thesepeople. And so Silicon Valley is here with all these people that were willing totake a risk—and fail. They were willing to fail. They’d take a risk and theywould fail, and if they failed, well, that’s too bad, we’ll try again. You spokeof culture—that’s the culture of Silicon Valley.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And that willingness to pick yourself up and start all over again— Edwards: Yes, start again.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: —is very indicative of this area.Edwards: Absolutely.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Route 68—what is the number?Edwards: Route 128.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, which, of course, is an industrial area, but my impression is that theculture is different.Edwards: It is different. It’s a very establishment culture back there. It’s the families thathave been there for generations, and society is built up around this structure,and it’s not nearly as flexible as California.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You don’t want to fail there, do you?Edwards: No, you sure don’t. Failing is bad! Working for a big company for your entirecareer and getting to be near the top or at the top—that’s good. That’s very bigtime.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I remember Bill Draper’s excitement about venture capital moving abroad.And he particularly mentioned India.Edwards: He went off to India.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is some of this culture being replicated elsewhere?Edwards: It’s hard to replicate. [interruption to change tape][End Audio File 3]Edwards: So the question was—taking venture capital abroad.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, and how much of Silicon Valley culture is replicated.Edwards: Well, it worked so well here because it was in the United States and we werefree and we had a legal system that worked pretty well. We had a financialsystem that was supportive and worked. The banking, and all that, was inplace and it was sturdy and it worked. Many things of that nature are requiredfor venture capital to thrive.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And then of course some of the government regulations that you talked about,like the capital gains tax.Edwards: Yes, that’s right. Absolutely. So you go to China and you’ve got thecommunist government sitting on you, directing how things go. You go toJapan and you’ve got Japan, Inc., where the ideas all come from the top andthey say we’re going to do this business, we’re going to be in this business,we’re going to be in this business, we’re not going to be in those businesses,and so forth. Those are not good places for venture capital.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, very closed, isn’t it?Edwards: Yes, and they don’t have the flexibility. Now I’ve got an investment— I’vetried to get into China with a venture sort of approach, and I’ve failed, andI’ve failed. But I now have one that I’m hopeful for, and I think it has a betterchance than any of the others I’ve been in. [chuckling] And I’ve got aninvestment in India which I’m moderately optimistic about. But even so, itisn’t like it is here. The United States is unique in our amount of freedom—and getting to be less all the time. But that is a wonderful thing about here,and that’s why venture capital has been so successful. For thirty years I had an office at 3000 Sand Hill Road, and it looked out onthe middle of the campus there. And I saw a busload of Japanese come in, awhole bus load. And they got out of the bus and they kind of went—choom—in all sorts of directions; they all had their assignments to go and do this anddo this. They were trying to figure out how venture capital worked, and 3000Sand Hill was the international capital of venture capital.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Still is, is it not? Edwards: It’s pretty damned important, but now it’s widened out. Instead of being thereonly, it’s in a radius of half a mile or a quarter of a mile east of 280. But it’sstill right there. And so they were there to try to figure out how are theseAmericans doing venture capital? They didn’t have a prayer, not a prayer. Inever saw a busload of Japanese come in after that. I’m sure they were therechecking us out, just as we might go look at an automobile plant in Japan, butanyway.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because of this rigidity or closed-ness?Edwards: Yes, and I mean India is a place that’s been basically socialist and beencontrolled by the federal government. Bill Draper started a venture deal inIndia. It was basically Indian-oriented. Practically all of his good investmentswere here, where the Indian CEO was here and the work was being done inIndia.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why did you decide to move abroad?Edwards: Because I think it’s a big world, it’s a big world. And there are opportunities.So I was hoping I could find something that would grow, and maybe I have[telephone ringing] in what I’m doing now. I wonder where my housekeeperis.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: If you think that that’s enough on venture capital, I would like to turn to someof your extracurricular activities. Have we covered, to your satisfaction,venture capital?Edwards: We could talk about venture capital for days. Have we covered it? I thinkwe’ve covered a lot of it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is there anything in a summing-up fashion that you would like to say?Edwards: Well, I’m awfully glad I’ve been here these years and I’ve had a fabulous lifein Silicon Valley and with venture capital and I’m very happy with it. I’m anold man, and if I go tomorrow I’m not unhappy about the whole thing. It’sworked out fabulously.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: We don’t want you to go tomorrow. All right, let’s see. You know I took afew notes from our conversation off tape last time. Edwards: By the way, did you read that book [Evolution of Religion] I gave you?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, I did.Edwards: Did you really?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I skimmed it.Edwards: You should go to the back of it. Read the last couple of chapters and then ifyou’re interested go back and look at more.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I will. I remember your telling me that you wrote that book with your childrenin mind. One of the things you said last time was that you wanted to discussteaching finances to your children.Edwards: Mmm—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: No? [chuckling]Edwards: I started out early on kind of running a bank account for them and puttingtheir allowance into the bank account and then they could draw out of it, andso forth. And they’ve lived in this house, and we talk about whatever we’retalking about. So I guess I have had some effect on their thinking aboutbusiness.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you see it in how they run their lives?Edwards: Well, I’m happy to see they’re all working and they’re doing interestingthings.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes! [chuckling] Well, you have a very charming younger son. I canguarantee that.Edwards: He’s my youngest son, that’s Paul.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: He’s a sweetheart. Edwards: Little fellow. He is a sweetheart, a Berkeley grad. An Old Blue along with mywife.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is she too? Well, I’m glad we’ve got some Berkeley connection here.Edwards: Yes, we have Berkeley connections.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well then, the Hoover Institution. You have been on that board—Edwards: A long time.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It’s here somewhere if I can just find my notes. From 1993!Edwards: Mmm.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How did you come to be appointed to the board?Edwards: Well, a friend of mine thought I would be interested in Hoover ,and so I wentto a couple of meetings, and I was interested in Hoover. What Hoover does isvery harmonious with my feeling about the world.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What do you mean by that?Edwards: Well, it believes in freedom. That’s the main theme of the Hoover Institution,is freedom. It has the reputation of being an archconservative organization. Ithink about 30 or 35 percent of the fellows—and there are 140 fellows atHoover, very bright people, men of great accomplishment before they getthere—about 30 or 35 percent of our fellows are registered Democrats! Ithappens to be an organization that seeks a solution to problems, and it’s aimedat long-term problems, what we would call in the venture business basicresearch. We’re not trying to solve the problem of today in Washington, DC.We’re trying to look forward and see what works and how to improve oursystem.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And when you say system—you mean economic, political, everything.Edwards: The American economic, social, the whole thing, the whole thing. So that’swhat they do. I am so appreciative for having been born in this country and 70have been free in my entire life to come and go and do as I want to do—it’s agreat blessing. When I think about other places where I could have beenborn—Soviet Union, Communist China, Cambodia under Pol Pot, Cuba underCastro. You go to a socialist or communist nation and you don’t havefreedom. You go to Africa where there’s nothing—there’s not much in theway of philosophy and so forth going on there. It’s a kind of a trying-tosurvive place. I wasn’t born in any of those places. I was born here, and I’veenjoyed freedom my entire life. It’s been a great benefit, and it’s why SiliconValley exists—it’s the freedom and the people that came here to do what theywanted to do. Hoover—it stands for freedom as the principal thing; it’s economic freedom,political freedom, and individual freedom. And that I believe inwholeheartedly, and God knows we need it because the government iscontinuing to get bigger and bigger and every year they’re passing more laws,more control, and I just find that difficult. I’m sorry to see that happening. Aswe talked about when we first sat down—what’s happened to the venturebusiness because the government is encroaching, encroaching, andcontrolling. It’s happening right now, you know. The government is theprincipal owner of General Motors, and on and on and on, and it’s takingmore and more control. And I think that—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Excuse me—but that too is cyclical, just the way the economic—Edwards: Yes, it is, it can cycle back and forth, and I think Hoover might be able to be avoice that’ll lead it away from the federal government or any governmentcontrolling everybody all the time.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And how exactly does it do that? By publishing policy reports and that sort ofthing?Edwards: Well, we’ve had many people from Hoover in the federal government—workthere. But we do publish. We have a major outreach program. We bring themedia in to Hoover. We bring eighty or ninety people from the media toHoover every year for a week, two or three at a time come to Hoover andspend a week,and they can do whatever they want to do. They can do nothingor they can be with the fellows and talk to the fellows, and if they’re interestedin some particular area they can go to someone who’s specializing in that area.So they have had some, I assume, effect on the media a bit. We publish books;we have a television program—we’ve had it anyway; [it’s] not running rightnow. We have Internet; we have a publication every day, the Hoover [Daily]Report; it’s on the Internet. And lots and lots of other things of that nature.  We are trying to educate the nation on the virtues of freedom and the virtuesof the things that have made America a great nation now for 220 years. Soanyway—that’s what Hoover does, and it’s got some great people there.Condoleezza Rice is a Hoover fellow. The guy that was the head of theCouncil of Economic Advisors is a Hoover fellow—the one that just passed.Many, many people go on from Hoover into the federal government and thencome back to Hoover.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see. Are they fellows for a given term of time?Edwards: No. They’re fellows until they’re asked to be no longer a fellow. George [P.]Shultz is a fellow; Milton Friedman was a fellow at Hoover. We have somegreat men, great, great men that are at Hoover today that are doing some ofthe leading, most innovative thinking—flat tax, et cetera, which would be agreat assist to the nation if we took the burden of that off of the people. I heard a talk once from a Nobel laureate—what’s his name?—I’ve forgotten.Anyway, it was a Nobel laureate and he wanted to give a talk, and he gave atalk on what makes nations great. And I thought, I know what makes nationsgreat—it’s freedom, it’s the legal system, it’s the financial system, currency.It’s all this stuff. And so [I said to myself], “I’m not going to go to that. Ialready know the answer.” Then I finally said I’m going to go and hear what he has to say. And I went,and he didn’t say a word about any of those things. He said, “The thing thatmakes nations great is when the industry of the nation is the least encumberedby extraneous costs, whether the cost is plaintiff’s attorneys that are suing himall the time and shaking him down for money, whether the cost is taxation,whether the cost is regulation, whether the cost is adding more and moreinsurance to insure yourself against all this stuff.” All of these things that aretotally unproductive; they don’t produce a thing. They just sit on top of theproductive process weighting it down. You get enough of that stuff and thenthe system doesn’t work. He said a good example of a system that didn’t work is Russia, becauseeverything came down from the top. They did all the planning from the top.They did five-year plans, and then they tried to execute those plans as opposedto having them start at the bottom and come up. They all came down from thetop. And so the planner would have to decide—the shoe business needs thismany nails, and he needs this much leather, and they need to produce thismany shoes, and they went off and did that. Then they produced shoes thatnobody really wanted, [chuckling] that didn’t work very well, that came apart,or whatever. And that was a result of all this weight on industry that was justburdening it down rather than letting it go and let it be free and let it try toserve the public, try to serve the market. And I think that’s true. And the more we load it up with regulation, government control, control of people that don’tknow what they’re doing most of the time—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And yet look what’s happening right now. Many people argue that some ofthe difficulty that we have right now is that the financial institutions were notadequately regulated.Edwards: Absolutely, absolutely. They were probably well-enough regulated butnobody was paying attention, and the people doing the regulating— And therewere warnings about the dangers of derivatives coming from very brightpeople, and nobody paid any attention. So I think that having someorganization in Washington that could supervise this and blow the dangerwhistle—not blow it all the time, but occasionally blow it—and that wouldalso know that the more burden you put on the economy the less successfulit’s going to be. And there’s a lot of burden on it now. There’s so muchaccounting burden coming out of Sarbanes-Oxley—read that thing I gave you.It’s right on venture capital, and I think it would be useful for you.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, I will definitely read it.Edwards: Anyway, Hoover I think is a great think tank, and they are not aiming foranything except success of the nation, and some very, very bright people aredoing the work. Now you know more about Hoover than you wanted to.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It’s always been a name without much attached to it in my mind, so I’m gladto hear. Let’s talk a little bit about philanthropy.Edwards: Let me say one more thing.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes.Edwards: A few years ago the magazine The Economist, from out of London, ranked thethink tanks of the world. They took twhat they considered the top twenty-fivethink tanks and then they ranked them on mental firepower and assets andwhat-all—all sorts of impact on the world. They ranked Hoover number onein the world.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Really! Edwards: And number two was a think tank in Peru or Ecuador. It was a man that waspushing the idea of property rights, something that simple. But the peasants,the natives, lived on ground they didn’t own. They had nothing that they couldcall their own and they could take to the bank and borrow money on oranything. So he was just trying to get property rights installed in the nation,and they picked that as number two. I just thought I’d toss that in. Go ahead.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, there’s a lot of philanthropy to talk about, but you wanted particularly totalk about the Boys and Girls Club and the Tipping Point [Community]. Arethose two good ones to talk about?Edwards: Wonderful, wonderful.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, tell me why you chose those particular organizations.Edwards: Well, many people are born in this country that really don’t have much of achance. They’re born in a family that was not prepared to raise children ortake responsibility for the children or even capable of taking responsibility.These are our citizens of the future, and they’re boys and girls. They’re littlekids. And you can’t take the place of the parents, but you can lean in thatdirection, maybe even affect how parents behave. So these kids were gettingout of school over in East Palo Alto and East Menlo Park and East RedwoodCity; they were getting into trouble, and they were not trying to learnanything. They didn’t like school and et cetera, et cetera. The idea of the Boys and Girls Club was to get them at an early age and givethem someplace to go when their parents were both working or away orwhatever, where they could get some constructive training and where theycould play games or whatever, but not on a street corner and not involved inpeddling drugs. And so that’s what the Boys and Girls Club is, it’s very, verybasic. And they’re doing a great job. They’ve got major facilities in all threeof the cities I mentioned, and they’re all over the country. They’re in SanFrancisco and everywhere. They’re doing a great job everywhere at a very,very essential job and they’re having an effect. It’s hard to measure, butthey’re certainly pushing it in the right direction.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What sorts of things do they offer the children?Edwards: They offer all kind of help with homework; they offer remedial classes andthat sort of thing. They offer activities like art and they offer sports. Theywant the kids to be there because the kids want to be there and the kids’ll gothere. So it can’t just be drudgery—it has to be fun. And yet they do help them with their homework, and there are people out of the community who go andcounsel these kids. So it’s a great organization, nationwide. And I just supportthe clubs that are right here.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It’s been around for decades, hasn’t it?Edwards: Oh a long, long time. And I think they do a good job. I go visit themoccasionally. You asked [about] another one. Oh the Tipping Point. It’s abright young guy who was in New York and came into contact with a fund inNew York, something like Tipping Point. It’s young people in this company,in the Tipping Point, young people who are in this area, in San Francisco andthe Bay Area, who are working at the very lowest level of philanthropy, withorganizations that someone has started that don’t have the kind of resourcesthey need and that have a very difficult time raising money. And TippingPoint finds these organizations, and it takes money it’s raised from the generalpublic, well, basically from philanthropists, and it takes the money and puts itto work. It’s working at a level that the Bay Area philanthropists wouldn’t getto.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because it’s way below the radar.Edwards: It’s way down, way down below the radar, very basic stuff. But people thatare well motivated and doing the right thing and struggling and trying—and soTipping Point is supporting those people. And it could be in all kind of ways.It could be just providing housing for somebody, but more likely it’s going tobe some sort of an active philanthropy of some sort.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And for a set period of time?Edwards: As long as needed. As long as they feel that they’re needed, until theorganization can get going on its own.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you know what their success rate is?Edwards: Well, it’s only been going about three or four years, so it’s a little bit early forthat. But I think the success rate of the one in New York has been excellent,and I’ve forgotten what the name of that is. So it’s taking money fromphilanthropic-oriented people and channeling it into a place that it wouldnever get otherwise.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Sounds wonderful. Edwards: It is wonderful; it’s a great charity.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I have listed the Pacific Legal Foundation.Edwards: Well, that’s back toward Hoover.The Pacific Legal Foundation is what it says.It’s a legal foundation that is looking to preserve property rights. So they willtake cases of someplace where the EPA, or something, has applied some ruleentirely incorrectly and has basically taken the value of somebody’s propertyaway from them. So they take those selectively; they frequently get to theSupreme Court with these cases, and their success rate is high. Basically, it’slooking out for private property, which is the freedom to own property and nothave it taken away from you by the government.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And that means things like eminent domain?Edwards: Right. Absolutely. I’ve forgotten the details of it, but there was somecranberry farmer back in Connecticut or somewhere, back on the East Coast.And the EPA came in and basically took his property away from him becausethey said he was on wetlands—and it probably was wetlands.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You sort of need that for cranberries!Edwards: It was still wetlands, but they just basically took it. “You can’t be thereanymore.” That’s the kind of thing that they’d fight. That’s the sort of thingthey do. They’re looking to preserve freedom from being usurped by thegovernment.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And is the Pacific Legal Foundation kind of a spin-off of the Hoover?Edwards: No, no, no. It’s a separate entity. They’re now doing things that arenationwide, but the name is the Pacific Legal Foundation and it’s basically aproperty rights thing.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Then I know you sit on a Stanford board.Edwards: A Stanford board? I’ve been involved in fundraising at Stanford for manyyears.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: No, there was a board that I picked up somewhere. Edwards: Oh could it be SIEPR? That’s the Stanford Institute for Economic PolicyResearch.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Exactly.Edwards: I’m on that board.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, do you want to say something about that?Edwards: Well, that’s what it says it is. The idea was conceived by George Shultz whowas a Hoover fellow. George Shultz, by the way, also had four cabinet posts.He was head of Office of Management and Budget, he was Secretary ofLabor, Secretary of the Treasury, and Secretary of State. Of all the men I’vemet in my lifetime, this is the man that I admire—I just think he’s the finestman I’ve ever met in my life. His instincts, his morals, his values, hisstandards are solid as a rock. Wonderful. He decided that on the Stanford campus we had economists in the engineeringschool, we had economists in the business school, we had economists in theSchool of Economics, we had economists in the law school and other places—all over the place in various departments. And they needed someplace theycould be together, you know, pull them all together. And so the StanfordInstitute of Economic Policy Research was founded. They are an educationalorganization. Hoover is tangentially an educational organization. I’ll mentionthat in a minute, but anyway, they support a lot of economics students withfellowships and financial aid, and they have projects going on that they areinterested that are being done by students. And that’s what it is. It’s a veryinteresting group. Hoover isn’t intended to have fellows that are faculty members. But we have anumber of joint appointments with Stanford, or that’ll be a Hoover fellow thatspends part-time teaching, so he’s a part-time teacher, part-time Hooverfellow. The Hoover fellow is doing what he wants to do and he likes that, buthe also wants to teach.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is that something new to have this teaching possibility?Edwards: Relatively new, and it’s growing pretty rapidly. If I can just tell you a littleyarn—the provost, [John] Etchemendy, is in charge of the various schools.The man that was the head of the Department of Economics in the School ofArts and Sciences wrote a letter to Etchemendy talking about what hadhappened to the Department of Economics—was it economics? No, it was the Department of Political Science at Stanford. He said that a Hoover fellow hadcome in and become involved teaching, part-time teaching, and then hadbecome head of the department. And he said, “When this all started, Stanfordwas not considered one of the better schools of political science in the nation.Harvard was [number] one and Stanford was totally out of the picture.” Atthat time Stanford was considered two and Harvard one. And he toldEtchemendy that he thought that pretty soon Harvard would be two andStanford would be one because of Hoover fellows. Anyway, I just thought I’dthrow that in. You seem a little incredulous about Hoover. I thought I’d justtoss that in.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You seem to be a pretty good promoter of the Hoover Institution.Edwards: Well, I believe in it. I believe in what they do.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] Well, then a man should speak to his passions!Edwards: Well, I do feel passionate about that. I feel passionate about freedom. I wouldlike to leave my children some part of the amount of freedom that I’veenjoyed in my life. Of the things that I could leave them, nothing could bemore precious—including cash.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And you’ve told them that?Edwards: Oh yes, yes. Of all the gifts I’ve been given, freedom is the greatest gift exceptmy life.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I think we’re winding up, but I’m wondering if you want to say anything moreabout your children and your family in general?Edwards: Well, I don’t have much to say. Just this—it is the rare person who leavesbehind anything of greater value to the world than the offspring. There aresome people—the Winston Churchills, the Hitlers, the Stalins—there aresome great men, the John Lockes and on and on, who have left behind morethan that—Thomas Jefferson, George Washington leave more than that. Butthe great bulk of us will die, and our death will be like a pebble in a lake;there’ll be a few rings that last for a few years and gone. And the one thingwe’ll leave behind is our offspring, and that is important to me, and I knowthat that’s the most important thing I’ll ever do. So that’s what I have to sayabout my family. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That’s very nice. Well, is that a good place to end? Do you want to say more?Edwards: I brought myself to the verge of tears!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, it was a very nice statement. I appreciate that and I appreciate your time.Edwards: Oh you’re very welcome. I’m happy to add this to the history of the world. Idon’t suppose anybody’s ever going to pay any attention to it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh don’t be so sure! Don’t be so sure.Edwards: Those are my feelings based on a lifetime of thinking and trying.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, you’ve certainly done that.Edwards: Thank you.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And now you can count some successes, I would say, in all regards.Edwards: Well, I hope so.
