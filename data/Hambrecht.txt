Interviewer: All right. It’s June 8, 2010, and we’re in the office of W.R. Hambrecht on PierOne in San Francisco. I’m talking with W.R. Hambrecht, William Hambrecht.Let’s start with your family of origin and your early education and how youeventually got into what you’re doing now.Hambrecht: Okay. Well, I was brought up on the South Shore of Long Island. My familywas from Brooklyn and the South Shore of Long Island. My dad Henry W.Hambrecht was with Mobil Oil Company. Socony [Standard Oil Company ofNew York], I guess it was called at that time. And I grew up in a typicalmiddle-class town and environment, became very interested in athletics as akid, and ended up going to Princeton, effectively on a football scholarship. Igraduated from Princeton in 1957.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: In history, I notice.Hambrecht: History major, that’s correct. Went into the army for six months on an ROTCprogram and went back to New York and got a job on Wall Street as a parttime thing before I went off to business school.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why were you oriented towards business school?Hambrecht: My dad and my uncles, everybody was in some form of business, and I grewup assuming I’d have to work for a living. [chuckling] There were a fairnumber of people who worked on Wall Street that lived in thisBrooklyn/South Shore of Long Island kind of thing. So I was exposed to it asa kid. I always thought it was kind of intriguing. I never quite understood whatmade a market work, but it was interesting to try and figure it out—anddecided that I would try and go to business school. I was supposed to go off toWharton in the fall, and I’d gotten very interested in the marketplace. A close friend of mine, Dennis Delafield from college, who had also been inthe army with me down at [Fort] Benning, had gone down to Florida to join aninvestment firm that his uncle had started years ago. And he kept in touchwith me and said, “Hey, why don’t you come on down and take a look at this,and let’s do it together.” So I decided, rather than go back to business school, Iwould go down to Florida and join Dennis in his small firm. It was in centralFlorida, and I was, in effect, assigned the east coast of central Florida, whichwas Cape Canaveral, which was the start of the technology world. So I spentthree years down there, helped finance three or four of the early digitaltechnology companies that had sprung up around Cape Canaveral. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Could you call this venture capital that you were doing?Hambrecht: No. Well, yes and no. There were a couple of private placements. It was alsotaking some of these smaller companies public, doing some IPO work. So itwas a combination of private and public. And then our firm was acquired by aChicago firm, and they moved me back to Chicago. Then that firm wasacquired by a New York firm, the F.I. du Pont Company, and so I ended up inNew York. During that time I had built a portfolio of investments in some ofthese digital companies, for the firms I was with. Then one of them, ModularComputer, worked out very well—no, it wasn’t Module—SystemsEngineering Labs was the first one. And I developed a reputation, in theory, ofunderstanding the early computer business. I would be the first to admit I stilldon’t understand the science, but I did make some wonderful friendships andcontacts in Florida with some of the early scientific people that had developedthe whole missile program.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So this was your graduate education in technology and in finance, was it not?Hambrecht: Well, that’s true, although when I was in Chicago I did go to the University ofChicago business school at night.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh, you did.Hambrecht: I didn’t finish because I got merged out of Chicago, but I did get somefinancial training there which was very good.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: A history major, I would think, would not be the immediate background forwhat you were doing.Hambrecht: No, no. But the whole scientific development around the missile program Ithought was fascinating. I met some really interesting people. Several of thembecame real mentors, almost through my whole life, and I was just veryfortunate to be exposed to that kind of program and those kind of people.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were they looking upon you as something unusual as well in what you weretrying to do? Or was this rather an established way of financing at that time?Hambrecht: Well, you see, everything was so new. And it was very clear that Wall Streetdidn’t understand, really, what was happening. Nor did they particularly wantto, because it was very small. These companies were half a dozen people getting together. Wall Street, particularly in the fifties, was quite conservative.The premium was always on the very large, established companies. Therewere very few early-stage investors. Rockefeller was probably the first and thebest, but there really weren’t many. So it was probably inadvertent, but yes, Iwas there really to learn what the technology people were doing and then seeif I could relate it to Wall Street and find them some money. I was basically afundraiser, which I’ve been all my life! [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was the technology the original hook? What got you captivated?Hambrecht: Well, yes. The first computers were built down there to track the missiles, andthere was a little company called Soroban Engineering that was started byCharlie [Charles F.] West. Charlie had actually been at Berkeley as a studentand then at MIT, and he was one of the five or six scientists the governmentselected and sent down to Florida to try and develop the missile program.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And this is late fifties?Hambrecht: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That seems really early to me.Hambrecht: And early sixties. Oh yes, it was very early. The first computer I ever saw hadall the vacuum tubes, and it used to run for about a minute, and then it wouldcrash. [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did it fill a room?Hambrecht: Oh yes! It was huge. And I remember Charlie’s role was to develop theperipherals that would feed in and out of the computer. So he developed thefirst paper tape punch and that type of thing.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You didn’t have any specific technical background.Hambrecht: No.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But you could get enough of it to do what you needed to do? Because I wouldthink at some level you had to assess the technology, at least at a superficiallevel. Hambrecht: You know, I’ve often tried to think—okay, did I really understand it or didn’tI? And I think somehow or other, intuitively, it all sort of made sense to me. Itwas very logical that if you could do things in this kind of sequence, youwould be doing them faster and better, and it would lead to somethingproductive. I never quite understood the physics, although it was explained tome a lot. But I was fortunate in being able to see concrete examples, and if Ihadn’t seen those I’m sure I wouldn’t have gotten excited about it. But yes, Iultimately saw how you could move data. You could collect it; you couldanalyze it; you could make things better with it. So yes, I think I probablyunderstood the application of it reasonably well because I had some very goodteachers. I had really good mentors.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, that’s what was going through my mind. You were impressed also withthe people.Hambrecht: Oh absolutely. Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Does that become a theme?Hambrecht: Oh sure. The most of the early pioneers in technology were for the most partout of the academic environment initially. They were very focused. Of course,they were very bright, but also very charismatic in their way. It was hard notto get excited about it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I can imagine just from the way you’re describing it. Okay. So then the firm’sbought up, and you’re essentially out of a job.Hambrecht: I was in New York, and I was there to help integrate the firms. Once that wasover, yes, they offered me the San Francisco office of du Pont, on the idea thatSilicon Valley was starting—that I could go out and help develop the bankingbusiness on the Peninsula.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Had the office already been established?Hambrecht: Oh yes. They’d been here a long time.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So were they early on in recognizing the potential of Silicon Valley, whichwasn’t even called Silicon Valley at that point? Hambrecht: To be honest, no. I think it was more just trying to find an excuse to get meout of New York! [laughter] Find a place for me. And du Pont, at that timewas the third largest brokerage firm in the country, and the Allyn family, whohad been the first acquirers, they were the ones that were willing to invest inventure stuff. But the du Ponts were never really—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So this is the du Ponts of the du Pont de Nemours?Hambrecht: Yes, in theory it was too bad, because they were one of the first of the venturecapitalists. They put up the money to start General Motors. But they weremuch more conservative in their investment stance when I got there. And ofcourse, they were very much focused on chemicals and heavy industry andwere not oriented towards the technology.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So when did you arrive on the West Coast?Hambrecht: In 1965.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And what did you find?Hambrecht: Well, first we had a brokerage office out here that I had to sort through, whichI did. But then, oh, I just quickly gravitated down towards the Peninsula. Thefirst company I remember calling on was Farinon Electric, Bill [William B.]Farinon. He had been actually a roommate of John Allyn in college back East,and so I followed up on that. He had a small telephone equipment suppliercompany. We ultimately made an investment there, and I got to know some ofthe people who were in the telephone equipment business, and then that drewme towards the original Fairchild [Semiconductor] group where people likeBob [Robert N.] Noyce and the rest of them broke out.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And you invested there as well?Hambrecht: We had a small investment in Intel, yes. Unfortunately, we didn’t have muchmoney, so it wasn’t a big one. It was small.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But you’re doing venture capital, aren’t you?Hambrecht: Well, when I got to San Francisco, after I started digging around and seeingwhat was out here, I ran into George Quist. George had been one of the earlyentrepreneurs out here in San Francisco. He had started a company—or I guess he had been put into a company called Mandrel Industries, which was aelectronic sorting-machine company that had merged into Ampex. He got toknow Henry McMicking, who was, I think, the largest shareholder of Ampexat that point. So anyway, when this company was sold to Ampex, Georgedidn’t have anything to do, so he joined the Bank of America, and they starteda Small Business Investment Company, and he started investing with thebank’s SBIC. I got together with him, and we kind of saw eye to eye on howto do it, and we went out and did a few things together.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And he had been here longer, right?Hambrecht: Oh right. He was a native.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So he had some connections that maybe you didn’t?Hambrecht: He had all the connections in San Francisco, yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did he have a different way of looking at investment? Or were you prettymuch in sync?Hambrecht: No, he was actually an accountant by training.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was he!Hambrecht: Yes, and was a very sound business guy, just understood balance sheets verywell. It was a really good grounding. Never was really, terribly comfortablewith some of the technology, because so much of the assets in technology arenot financial.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, and were you feeling comfortable, or more comfortable anyway, with thetechnology?Hambrecht: Well, yes, I had realized at least in the seven years or so before in some of theinvestments I made that your intellectual assets were really the real assets, andthey don’t get carried on a balance sheet, or at least weren’t at that point. So Ithink we made a good mix. He grounded me pretty much financially, and Ithink I drove him more towards the technology. But it was a good mix.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What was happening in the Valley at that point? Hambrecht: Very little. The major technology centers were Hewlett-Packard, of course,Sylvania—they were some of the big government contractors. Very few smallcompanies.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And no venture capital partnerships yet, are there?Hambrecht: Not really. Well, I don’t know when exactly Sutter Hill started.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That was a little bit later. Draper, Gaither & Anderson is ’68-’69, somethinglike that. There were people doing what we now call venture capital, but in avery personal way.Hambrecht: Well, for example, when we started Hambrecht & Quist at the end of 1967,we went to Henry McMicking, who was probably the most well-knownventure guy because of Ampex; Prentis [C.] Hale who had investedaggressively in a lot of this; John Bryan, who had been with Blyth and thenstarted a specialty of investing in some of these companies; Bill Edwards—sothey were just starting. Arthur Rock had just come out. Intel was started in, Ibelieve it was, May of 1968. That was the exact month that Hambrecht &Quist got started. I really always thought that that was what really started it,when they broke out of Fairchild and set up Intel. That put in motion a kind ofa pattern that went way beyond our wildest dreams.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Right, that other people began to mimic. They opened the door to possibilities.Hambrecht: Right, right. So it was really the late sixties. Arthur Rock had been involved inone of the smaller computer companies, too, SDS [Scientific Data Systems], Ithink it was, before Intel. But he was the one who, I think, raised the mostmoney for Intel. He was out of New York, I think, at that time, and then hejust came out to the West Coast.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So what are the ingredients here? There’s technology burgeoning, but you’realso showing that big money can be made. Or is it big yet?Hambrecht: It wasn’t big, and that’s why I left to start Hambrecht & Quist with George,because I could never get anybody in New York interested in small offerings.The first offering we did at Hambrecht & Quist was Spectra-Physics.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh really! Hambrecht: Yes, they were the leading laser company. It was a $600,000 offering. And noone wanted to bother. No one wanted to bother.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Too small.Hambrecht: It was just too small. And the Intels of the world didn’t have the physicalassets that would attract a conventional investor. Virtually, it was verydifficult to get anybody interested in those kind of things.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why did you think you could do it?Hambrecht: Well, when we started Hambrecht & Quist, we really felt that we had to bringsomething else to the party to get accepted into the group, so to speak. Andbecause I’d had experience in public offerings, we went out to the venturecapital guys and said, “Look, we have a venture capital fund here; we’re goingto invest some money. When we get to know these companies we’ll be able tobring them public for you.”<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see. And they didn’t know how to do that?Hambrecht: They didn’t know how to do that, and the big firms didn’t want to do it. Andthere was really only one firm in New York, [C.E.] Unterberg, Towbin thatused to do that back there. And we said, “Hey, we’ll do it for you here.” Andnobody ever asked me, “Well, why do you think you could do it?” We justsaid we could! [laughter] And we went out and we found out by doing someof these—yes, there was a market for it. So that was really how we developedthe business. It was more to be included in the venture capital community thanany other reason.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Hambrecht & Quist was both a venture capital firm and an investmentbanking firm.Hambrecht: It was, yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Are you looking at those two aspects as very synergistic? Because at one levelI see those two things as possibly in conflict.Hambrecht: Well, actually, when we started, we did integrate both venture capital andinvestment banking. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: From the start.Hambrecht: From the start. For example, in Spectra-Physics, which we brought public, wehad actually made an investment in the company the year before. And yes,there were a lot of people that thought that might be a conflict of interest. Ourtheory was that, number one, if you lived with a company before you tookthem public, your odds of having good companies to take public improved,because you’d live with them for a while, you knew what you were dealingwith, and you got a feel for their technology and how good they were.Secondly, small companies were not very attractive financings from aneconomical point of view. But if we were a shareholder, and we could benefitas a shareholder, we thought, okay, that would be a good business model. Andas it turned out, if you go back for the thirty years H&Q was in the business,about 40 percent of the profits came from the venture and 60 percent frominvestment banking. And the great companies that we underwrote, Genentech,Apple, Netscape—all of those—we were shareholders when they wereprivate.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was that a criterion for your participation?Hambrecht: We started out that way, but we didn’t have enough money to do it all thetime. And then the underwriting business developed a business of its own, andwe had investment bankers join the firm. So ultimately it became more of anindependent business than it was in the beginning.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now, were you the first to do that? To combine those two entities?Hambrecht: Pretty much so, yes. Steve [Steven N.] Machtinger ended up as counsel forHambrecht & Quist for many, many years. Steve was a young lawyer with theSEC [Securities & Exchange] office in San Francisco, and he spent a yearinvestigating us, trying to decide whether this was really a conflict of interestor not! [laughter] And he finally decided it wasn’t and then ultimately becameour counsel.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Which some people could have looked at as a conflict of interest right there!Hambrecht: Well, maybe, but he was confident.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, that’s interesting isn’t it? One thing was feeding another, wasn’t it? Hambrecht: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: The money that you were making as a shareholder then fueled your venturecapital?Hambrecht: Well, it made a business model that was much more attractive, and we couldattract capital, and we could build the firm, yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You said you had experience in taking companies public, beginning inFlorida, right? But I’m imagining that there was a steep learning curve whenthis really became a major part of your business. I only have a vague idea ofthe intricacies of taking a company public, but I know it’s no easy thing:figuring out what the SEC requires and then getting the company itself in line.Hambrecht: Well, I never thought that there was very much to that, to be honest.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh really?Hambrecht: To me the trick in being an IPO underwriter is the judgment call of who doyou take public.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Okay, well, please talk about that.Hambrecht: Both George and I were not technology based. We were both, in effect,financial. And so the first person we hired, I remember, was a physics major,John Chulick from [Admiral Hyman G.] Rickover’s submarine program. Hisjob was to sort out the technology for us and try and identify what we thoughtwere the most promising technologies, and then the most promisingcompanies within those technologies. So that’s what we did very differently, Ithink, for the first twelve years we were in business. We basically hadengineers instead of financial people. And it gave us a great advantage forquite a while until Wall Street caught on, and then they started hiring all theirpeople from IBM. But it lasted, really, through the early eighties.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And then what changed?Hambrecht: Well, in 1980, up until then we had done smaller technology companies. We’dbuilt a nice firm; we were making a nice living. But then we had made aninvestment in Apple Computer and in Genentech. And in 1980, in a ninetyday period, those two companies went public, and we were the co-manager of both. In the case of Apple, it was the first time Morgan Stanley had ever comanaged with anybody.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Really! Wasn’t there a lead underwriter in Genentech?Hambrecht: It was Paine Webber.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Paine Webber, that’s right.Hambrecht: Paine Webber was the co-manager of Genentech. And we had owned sharesin both companies. We were the co-manager. I remember Fortune magazinethen wrote an article, and Fortune at that time was enormously influential, andI remember they titled it “The Folks Who Brought You Apple.” And that’swhat changed us from kind of a local, little firm into all of a sudden we wereraising money in Europe and life was beautiful. So—but that changed it verydramatically and propelled the investment banking business to the front of thefirm rather than the venture.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I know something about the Genentech IPO. I interviewed [Robert] Swanson,luckily while he was still well. And of course, as you probably remember, thatwas a precedent-setting IPO.Hambrecht: Oh yes, yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you go on the road trip?Hambrecht: Yes. I was with Bob through the whole thing.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Can you tell me some of your memories of how that went?Hambrecht: Well, first of all, being an investor in Genentech as we were— I guess wewent in it in 1976, so this was four years [later]. I remember George Quistkidding me when we first made the investment that Watson & Crick soundedlike a vaudeville team. Nobody really understood what Herb [Herbert W.]Boyer and Bob were saying. But Bob had a way of making it veryunderstandable.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: He was a good translator. Hambrecht: He was a very good translator. And he would put it in terms that a nontechnology person could understand what they were driving at. And so by thetime we went public, I was pretty familiar with everything that Bob and Herbwere doing, so I was pretty comfortable with it. The memories of it, though,that come back hard— Well, first of all, just some of the funny personal stuff.I’m trying to remember, somebody—was it Bob and Judy?—might almostmade a honeymoon out of it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: They did. The IPO was delayed. There had been an extension of the quietperiod because the SEC was worried about some publicity. Bob apparentlythought he had planned his wedding date so that the IPO would be completelyover. [Hambrecht laughs] Uh-uh. [laughter] So he told a very funny story ofSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Snow White was his wife and then he hadall these dwarfs—Hambrecht: Well, I was one of the seven dwarfs!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: --trailing around on their honeymoon!Hambrecht: Well, I remember being one of the seven dwarfs, along with Tom Perkins.Tom and I were there. It was fun. I remember some really funny, wonderfulevenings in Scotland and London. After the pricing, we went to New York,and Paine Webber was a very conservative, very good firm. I forget exactlyhow we arrived at the pricing. It was around $30 or $35. Was it $35?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It ended up being $35. Initially shares were priced from $25 to $30, I think,and then they realized how great the demand was.Hambrecht: Well, they did and they didn’t. They were scared to death of it, because Iremember they were just agonizing over whether they could go up to $35, youknow.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Paine Webber was?Hambrecht: Yes, yes. And so we had the long negotiation about gee, could we really do itat that price, and would it fall apart? And then it opened [on the stockexchange] at $85. I remembered thinking—hey, those guys don’t knowanything more about the market than I do! [chuckling] They were just beingconservative; they didn’t understand what was happening.  And to me what had happened with Genentech— When we first made theinvestment, we had a small venture capital fund funded primarily in Europe.One of the shareholders was the Firmenich Company, which was a very large,private Swiss company that made essence of perfume, a very high-endspecialty chemical company. And Robert Firmenich, who was the chairman,took a liking to our fund, and he used to come to the meetings. He used toscare me to death, but he was really smart. I used to try and prepare because Iknew he’d ask the questions. I went in, and I started explaining Genentechwhen we did it, and he said, “Hey, wait a second.” He just jumped on it andunderstood it so much better than I did, and immediately. They made aninvestment in it later and did very, very well.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did he have a background in biology?Hambrecht: Yes. And so to me what that said is, hey, the industry knew a lot more about itthan the financial people. And that was, I think, what happened in the IPO.They were smart people that figured out this was a really fundamentalrevolution, and that this was something very special. The financial peoplewere so used to looking at earning and balance sheets and everything. Andyou know, Genentech didn’t have a dime of revenue. It was zero revenue.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It didn’t have any products. And that was a new thing for investors, was itnot?Hambrecht: Oh yes. And I still remember the road show, where Bob was basically notpromising, but telling people, we thought we’d have insulin within a year, ayear and a half. It took four years [to market]. I remember when it was overBob sat me down and said, “You know, you’re going to have to help me tryand figure out—this is going to take a long time—how do we keep peopleinterested in this company?” And he did a great job. He really did. He alwayshad the enthusiasm; he communicated well. And so nobody ever lost faithwith Bob, even though it took longer. I thought he did a great job.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you think in his secret moments he had doubts?Hambrecht: Probably. We all did! [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But he certainly didn’t let it out even to you.Hambrecht: He didn’t let it out; he didn’t let it out. No, I’m sure he always believed in it.But look, it was a long, arduous process, and it didn’t happen overnight. Theyvery much earned their success, I think. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you go on to invest in other biology-based companies?Hambrecht: Yes. I guess we invested in Biogen and two or three others. And then theanalyst at Paine Webber, a fellow by the name of David [H.] MacCallum thatI had gotten to know on the offering, I thought was very smart and verybright. So we induced him to join Hambrecht & Quist, and he basicallydeveloped the Hambrecht & Quist healthcare group.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Ah, I see. So when would that have been?Hambrecht: In the early eighties. David did a great job, brought on some very brightpeople.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: When you saw a need for expertise in a certain area, you just hired it?Hambrecht: Well, we really looked for partners. How shall I put it? I think both Georgeand I realized that there were things that he and I didn’t really understand, andif we could find the right people to become partners with us, that would reallyhelp us enormously, because it was clear that you needed more than afinancial knowledge in these companies. You had to make judgments basedon science, on people, and the numbers were the last thing you looked at.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Right. Which, I would think was very different than the way the East Coastwas operating.Hambrecht: Absolutely.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: First of all, they probably were not heavily invested in technology to beginwith. But it was all pretty much a financial game, wasn’t it, as far as they wereconcerned?Hambrecht: Oh yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So again you were doing something new, weren’t you?Hambrecht: Yes. I still remember the epiphany I had on that. It was before we startedHambrecht & Quist, and it was with Farinon Electric. I went out to to see Billmillion in revenue and were profitable, but it was a small, little company. His father-in-law, who had put up the money— I don’t know whether he neededsome money or they had to get some liquidity. John Allyn, his old collegeroommate, was a partner of DuPont, so they sent me down, and he said, “CanI go public?” And I remember saying [to Bill], “Look, to go public you haveto have five years of earnings; you have to have $1 million of after-taxearnings;” you’ve got to have this, you’ve got to have that. I gave him the fouror five guidelines that we used on Wall Street. And he looked at me, and hesaid, “Who set up those rules?” [laughter] I said, “I don’t know. They’re justthe rules. I don’t know.” And he jumped at me, and he said, “Look, thosegoddamn rules. They were set up for you guys! So you could make a lot ofmoney. They have nothing to do with me. How about looking at this from mypoint of view. I want my company to stay independent. I need some money.”Then on the way out, as I walked out the door, and of course he blistered meon the way out, he finally looked at me and he said, “Do you think I have agood company here?” And I said, “Oh yes. I think you really do.” And hesaid, “Would you put in some of your own money?” And I said, “Absolutely,I would love to buy stock.” And he looked at me and he said, “If you’rewilling to buy stock for yourself, why aren’t you willing to sell it to thepublic?” And that became the credo of Hambrecht & Quist. If we were willingto put up our own [personal] money, well, then be willing to sell it to thepublic. It’s still not a bad rule.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I’m imagining that after Genentech and Apple, two big hits, one right afteranother—Genentech went public in October 1980 and Apple in December.And as you’ve said, then Hambrecht & Quist was on everybody’s mind. Wereyou expanding at a rapid rate at that point?Hambrecht: We did. And too quickly. We had a small organization. I think we hadseventy-five people in the firm when this all happened. And probably threequarters of them were non-professional process type—so very few people.The opportunity was to underwrite anybody. We thought we were maintainingour quality screen, but we really didn’t.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because you just couldn’t spend the time?Hambrecht: Well, we should have but we didn’t. You know you go through a period likethat and you start believing your own press clippings a little bit, and webrought in some new people who we didn’t have a lot of experience. So wemade some decisions that brought us back to earth pretty quickly. By the mideighties we were sort of like the other guys. But we were still there, and westill had a good firm, and we’d learned a lot, and I think we’d startedrecovering. I think the eighties, where we were really fortunate, was we werevery early on software. A couple of people—David [C.] Evans, who was a real mentor to me, who had been the head of Computer Science at Berkeleyand then at Utah, Ben Wegbreit who came out from MIT—they both realizedthe future was going to be in software and that the hardware business wasgoing to become a commodity.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see. And they were telling you that?Hambrecht: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And these were just acquaintances?Hambrecht: Well, no. I was on Dave’s board, Evans & Sutherland.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So you had insider knowledge.Hambrecht: And I was an investor in Convergent [Technologies], which was Ben’scompany. And then when that sold out, Ben joined us as a partner. So webecame real partners.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So networking is a big part of this, isn’t it, these interpersonal connections?Hambrecht: Oh sure. Well, Dave Evans, for example—his postdoc group. John Warnock,who started Adobe, was a postdoc with Dave. Jim Clark; Jim was a postdoc.Many of the guys with Steve Jobs in Pixar, they all came out of there. Yes,you’ll find common heritage or bonds for a lot of these people. I was just reminded of it, looking at a story the other day. The first softwarecompany to go public was Cullinet, and Hambrecht & Quist brought thempublic in about the mid-eighties, ’85, ’86, something like that. We startedAdobe in ’82, Sybase, Mercury, AOL. We were start-up investor in a lot ofthose. So even though we weren’t nearly as hot publicly, and we looked morelike a conventional firm, probably the best investments we made were in thepost-Apple era where we invested heavily in software. And then the first placeI ever heard the word Internet was at Adobe, and so that ultimately led toNetscape and a bunch of other Internet things.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You were making mistakes, but you were still doing all right. [chuckling] Hambrecht: Actually, privately, we were doing a lot better than probably the worldthought. And we didn’t really realize how well until the nineties when thebubble happened.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were you still the company to come to when a tech company wanted to gopublic?Hambrecht: Well, by then Robertson [Stephens] had developed as a competitor.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was that fierce?Hambrecht: We got along pretty well. Sandy [Robertson] and I always were reasonablyfriendly. Competitive but friendly, and we did a number of things together.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Who else was out there?Hambrecht: Montgomery Securities. They were a little more competitive. But they were alittle more different; they were more trading oriented, looking at the biggercompanies. Alex Brown [& Sons] and Unterberg were still out there. So yes,there were four or five firms.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But there was enough business that you weren’t really worried about yourcompetitors?Hambrecht: We managed to keep our share or better. Part of it was the relationship we hadwith Morgan Stanley. We had been the first person to co-manage with them.We had a very special relationship there because one of my closest friends, aguy I went to college with, was Dick [Richard B.] Fisher, who ended uprunning Morgan Stanley. So we had a very special relationship lasting up untilthe day Dick retired in the mid-nineties. That helped—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: If you were going to penetrate that East Coast mentality, it would be veryhelpful to have a friend who had faith in you. But another question alongthose lines is, is East Coast mentality changing? They’re seeing this thinghappening out West—Hambrecht: Sure. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: --that is obviously being very successful, making money, bringing newtechnology to the public. How can they ignore that?Hambrecht: Well, it was interesting. Dick and I were good friends, and he was just verysupportive throughout the whole thing, but he was also very smart and a toughguy. First of all, when we sort of sprang to prominence after the Apple andGenentech thing, all the investment bankers from the East Coast showed upand said, “Okay. We want to work with you.” And I’d say, “Well, whatcompanies are you interested in?” And they’d all start with the biggest. Andwhen I asked Dick, he started with the best technical companies. So I thought,boy, he’s figured it out already. Somehow or other they sorted it out, and theytargeted on the really good technology companies.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: He had enough pull that he could pull his whole company along with him?Hambrecht: He actually took over Morgan Stanley in 1982.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That’s handy for you! [chuckling]Hambrecht: Oh yes. Well, the Apple deal would have never happened without him. Hewas the one who did the Apple deal. He was extraordinarily important. But hewas smart about it, and we had a fifty-fifty deal, which of course all thosepeople hated because Morgan Stanley never went fifty-fifty with anybody. Hetold me later, he said, “Look, sure I wanted to help, and we have a goodrelation, and I wanted to keep it going, but I also thought that almost all thecompanies we were going to underwrite probably would never really needmoney again.” Which is true. The Apples, the Adobes—those companiesnever needed money again, so they weren’t particularly good investmentbanking clients. And what he said was, “You know, what they’re really goingto do is they’re going to create a lot of wealth. And we have a good system ofmanaging wealth.” And he knew we didn’t. So he said, “Okay, we’ll do fiftyfifty in the underwriting, and we’ll get all the other business.” And that’sexactly what happened.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So everybody was happy.Hambrecht: Everybody was happy. We probably should have figured that out too, but wedidn’t.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It worked out. Hambrecht: It worked out. Well, look, I’d never second guess my relationship with Dick.He was wonderful.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, you were fortunate there, weren’t you.Hambrecht: Oh yes. Very.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What is Hambrecht & Quist consisting of in the eighties? I read about tradingfloors and all of that. Were you large enough to have that kind of thing goingon?Hambrecht: We were an active market maker in the companies that we underwrote, andthat became a very important part of our business.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I don’t really understand what that means.Hambrecht: Well, in the eighties and the nineties, when companies went public, they werenormally initially traded in the NASDAQ market. And the NASDAQ marketis a dealer market. It’s not a specialist exchange market; it wasn’t then. Sothere would be us and maybe another half-dozen firms competing in acomputerized system, but to make a market. And what that says is you offer abid and an offer, so that there’s always a continuous market. And that becamea very profitable business for us, and we continued that up until when the firmwas finally sold to Chase [Manhattan Corporation].<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was that an obvious way of going?Hambrecht: Well, first of all it was thought to be a responsibility of the underwriterinitially.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Who? You mean the people who were coming to you?Hambrecht: In other words, if you brought a company public, then you took on theobligation to make a market in the aftermarket. Now the reality was it was soprofitable that other firms figured it out and said okay! [laughter] So it becamecompetitive. And then rather than an obligation, it became a very nice part ofthe business.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But Hambrecht & Quist was the first to do that? 20Hambrecht: No. Well, there were always dealer shops, but I think we were probably one ofthe first of the specialty underwriters to realize that gee, this is a goodbusiness. And so that generated the revenue where we could build up ourresearch department and reach out and build up the services.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: None of which you had in the beginning?Hambrecht: Very little.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So it was really Hambrecht & Quist going out and using their networkingskills and their other skills.Hambrecht: In the research department when the Apple and Genentech deal came along, ifI remember correctly, I think we had one corporate finance banker, and wehad five analysts. But the five analysts worked on deals, which again isfrowned on now. But it was the idea that if you’re going to bring a companypublic and it’s a software company, you probably want to have a softwareengineer explain it to somebody. So we had a couple of software engineersthere; we had people with different backgrounds, but they were technologybased people. And then after that, we started hiring more financially orientedanalysts, more Wall Street types, and also more bankers, to deal with the—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So you’re getting a little bit closer to the East Coast counterparts.or ’82.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And was that kind of inevitable?Hambrecht: Looking back I think, yes, if you’re going to run a business to optimize itsprofitability and its scale, yes, probably. I didn’t like it as well.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, I’ll bet you didn’t. It’s not as exciting, is it? [laughing]Hambrecht: I needed both models. I didn’t think we were doing as high-quality work aswe did in the beginning. In the beginning we could be more selective. Wedidn’t have an overhead we had to cover every day, so we could kind of sitback and wait. Business-model pressures force you into more of a day-to-daybusiness. Look, we tried to keep certain principles intact, and we had some really good people. A lot of good people joined us. It was a good firm. Ithought Hambrecht & Quist was a very good firm. But it changed.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I’m not a business historian, but I have thought about how success itselfbrings problems, in a certain way.Hambrecht: Oh yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I’m thinking of the start-up firm with that culture that is so much talked about,that is so difficult to preserve when you become big and hopefully successful.Hambrecht: Right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It seems to me that something kind of similar is going on. You’re forced tochange from what made you great in the beginning.Hambrecht: Yes. Even if you try and fight it, you do change, because you do have to bringin more people; you bring in a bigger mix of talents, and it’s different.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But it also means that people like you who were there in the beginning for areason, because that’s what you were good at and probably found exciting,maybe had more problems later on.Hambrecht: Yes. Well, that’s why I ultimately went back to the same model which I usedat Hambrecht & Quist.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Shall we talk about that? Are we there?Hambrecht: Sure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Let me ask you a few more words about venture capital before we leaveHambrecht & Quist. Your curriculum vitae says that you became directlyinvolved in the venture capital business in the 1970s, very soon after youcame out west. And I presume you mean as Hambrecht & Quist, right?Hambrecht: As Hambrecht & Quist.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: By the early seventies there are people that are doing what we would now callventure capital. I’m thinking of Kleiner & Perkins and Sutter Hill and Draper, Gaither [& Anderson]. Is there any sort of resentment that here you, aninvestment banking firm, are getting involved in their territory? Was theresome tension between you and the people who were just venture capitalists?Hambrecht: Maybe a little. Not the guys who were really there in the beginning becausewe all sort of started at the same time. For example, like Tom Perkins. Weknew Tom because when he was at Hewlett-Packard he’d made an investmentin a little laser company. And we helped merge them into Spectra-Physics andworked with Tom on it. As a matter of fact, we asked Tom to join our firm torun the venture capital! [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh really!Hambrecht: And he got together with Gene Kleiner, and they decided to do it themselves.But we always had, I think, a really good relationship with Tom and Gene. Sowith those people, no. But yes, maybe [some resentment by other venturecapitalists]. But we were co-investors with a fair number of some of the earlyKleiner stuff. I think where we actually became more independent as venturecapitalists was when we essentially made our bet on software. I think we wereearly there, and so no one was really fighting us. I remember the first Adobedeal. We really had trouble putting it together.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Really, because people just didn’t—Hambrecht: People just didn’t know. And at that point the Apples and the hardwarecompanies, the Digital Equipments, and the peripheral disk drive companies,they were the ones that had everyone’s attention.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you think because you had a slightly different background and outlookthan the venture capital partnerships per se that you might look at a deal withslightly different eyes?Hambrecht: I don’t think so. I think it was just having a couple of technology people thatwere a little ahead of the curve, to be honest.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So you were on a level playing field.Hambrecht: It was all a level playing field, and I think Dave Evans and Ben Wegbreit anda couple of those guys were just ahead of the curve. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: To drive home a point: all this is totally contingent on having venture capitalavailable. Is it not? To get these companies up and going and financed so thatthey get to a point where they can even consider becoming a public company.Hambrecht: That’s correct, yes. Less so today than it used to be, because again, softwareand the Internet changed everything. I forget how much Apple raised, but itwas quite a bit of money before they got public. And the typicalsemiconductor company that got started in those days would take $30, $40,$50 million, which doesn’t sound like a lot now. But you know, we startedAdobe with $2 million, and we only used $1.2 million of it. And the puresoftware or intellectual property companies that have been so successful insoftware and on the Internet really don’t need much money, so there’s more ofan angel culture out there now. Google didn’t really get any venture moneyuntil they were well on the way. They were basically funded by individualsdown at Stanford, and once the product was up then they brought in Kleinerand Sequoia. And that’s kind of the pattern you see a lot now, because youdon’t need the big money. Of course, most of the venture funds that have beensuccessful have raised a lot of money, so they have to put a lot of money towork.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Which is a problem in itself, isn’t it?Hambrecht: Very much so, very much so, I think.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, anything you want to say about that pre-W.R. Hambrecht & Companyperiod?Hambrecht: No, other than it was a very fortunate and wonderful experience in that I thinkit was an opportunity to try out some new ideas; it was an opportunity to tryand be a little different. And I think the reality of it is we rode the wave. Iwish I could have honestly told you we saw the wave coming, but at least wegot on the top of it for a while and rode it! [laughing]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you have any personal life at this time?Hambrecht: Oh yes. Oh sure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You could put all this within some boundaries? Hambrecht: Look, I was very different personally than my partner George Quist. He was avery flamboyant, very unusual guy. But I think one of the things that broughtus together was we didn’t take each other too seriously, and we enjoyed life.He had a family, and he loved to go out, and he loved to play golf, and heloved to do a lot of things, and so did I. So our culture was never the 4:30 inthe morning till midnight kind of stuff. We just never did that, and we spentweekends at home. I had five kids and a great wife Sally [Sarah P.Hambrecht]. She became part of it and liked to travel with me and do some ofthis stuff. So yes.I early in the game decided in this business sooner or later you’re judged onresults, and the results are almost always conditioned by your judgment andnot appearing to work harder than anybody else. I find in this business it’sgood to take time away and keep a little bit of distance between some of thesethings so that you can think them through.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How did you get that mentality? I can imagine in the whirl of Silicon Valleyculture that it wouldn’t be that difficult to get caught up.Hambrecht: Well, some of the intense software development cycles people get caught upin. But I find the Valley has a nice way of life. A lot of people develop verynice balanced lives down there. I don’t think it’s like a law firm in New Yorkor a Goldman Sachs kind of environment. I don’t think it’s that way at all.[End Audio File 1]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: In 1998 you sold Hambrecht & Quist?Hambrecht: No, I left Hambrecht & Quist in 1998. The firm was sold in 1999 to Chase.What happened was in late ’87, early ’88 I think it was, Merrill Lynch came inand made an offer to buy Hambrecht & Quist. At that point I had steppeddown as co-CEO. I had been CEO, then co-CEO with Dan [Daniel H.] Case[III], and then I believe in ’87 or so I stepped back and became chairman andDan was CEO, a very brilliant, very bright guy. He had been with us forever,and he was really great. Merrill Lynch came in, and I think Dan had decidedthat for us to really succeed as we had before, we had to team up withsomebody with a big balance sheet and a big structure. And he was capable ofrunning a big firm. He was really a strong manager. I wasn’t. I didn’t want to.So he was oriented very much to doing the Merrill Lynch thing. It was at this point that I had come to the conclusion that instead of mergingwith somebody, we should try and do it differently. The patterns that had developed in the IPO business and in the investment business—I just wasn’tcomfortable with a lot of it. And so I said, “Hey, we do have to change. Butlet’s differentiate ourselves by doing it differently as opposed to linking upwith someone.” But I also said, “Hey, it’s really your call with the rest of thepartners. I’ll do whatever everybody else agrees on.” So they got to the point with Merrill Lynch where there was a deal on thetable, and at the last minute I sort of became an issue because they wanted tosign me up along with everybody else, and I just didn’t want to do it. I said I’llbe fine with the sale but I’m going to move on. And then the deal fell apart forother reasons. So I went to Dan and said, “I probably shouldn’t be here now.You’re going to go in this direction; it’s going to happen; I don’t want to be anissue.” I wanted to start this smaller firm to go back to doing some of thethings that I like to do, and I wanted to try an auction and a few other things,so it was agreed that I would leave. I kept my shares. It was very friendly andeverything, at least initially. And then when we started doing some deals thathe liked, then it got a little more competitive. But it was done in the spirit of apartnership. And then a year later they did make a deal to sell to Chase.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And this merging was happening to others?Hambrecht: Oh yes, we were the last one. Yes, Robertson sold out, Unterberg had, AlexBrown had, Montgomery had. Everybody’d sold out.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why was it all of a sudden important to be big?Hambrecht: Well, that was my point. You know, I didn’t think a balance sheet meantanything in the IPO market. It really doesn’t. You don’t need a lot of capital.What the bigger firms do is they say that they can use their balance sheet tohelp these companies finance, and they do in some of the bigger companies,like in buyouts or mergers and acquisitions, where someone has to go in andbuy a piece of stock or put up money in front of a bank to get a bank to put aloan together. Yes, then it works. But mergers and acquisitions were almostno part of the technology world. The great companies grew organically; theydidn’t acquire anybody. So in our business I didn’t think it mattered. In themore conventional business it mattered a lot. And Dan was attracted to themore conventional business. If Dan had lived, he was capable of building andgrowing a large, diversified investment bank. So he was, like so many otherpeople that succeed a founder, his ambitions were broader, which is perfectlynatural. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But you had something that you wanted to do. Had you been thinking aboutthis other idea all along? Or were you forced into thinking, okay, I’m notgoing to be here at Hambrecht & Quist. What am I going to do?Hambrecht: Well, no. Originally when I first came to Dan and said, “You know, I reallythink we should go back to doing the small technology-based deals that wedid in the beginning. We’re all caught up in the big stuff.” What we did is weset up a subsidiary of Hambrecht & Quist to do smaller offerings. Dan namedit RVR, Risk Versus Reward. The idea was we were going to beat theChristensen game. Are you familiar with Clay [Clayton M.] Christensen’swork?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, only from what I’ve read on your Website. [chuckling]Hambrecht: Disruption? Well, he’s a fascinating guy. He, I guess as a postdoc, took up thequestion of why did the three most successful and admired technologycompanies in America, namely AT&T, IBM, and Digital Equipment— Theyhad the best technology; they had the best balance sheets; they hired the bestengineers, and were generally accredited to be the best-managed companies inAmerica. Why were all three brought to the verge of bankruptcy by newtechnologies? And his theory is that every now and then someone comes upwith a business model that’s dramatically different, usually empowered bytechnology, but there has to be a dramatically different business model.The numbers I use, Clay doesn’t exactly agree, but basically you’ve got todevelop a business that gives the customer about 80 percent of what he wantsfor 20 percent or less of the cost. That’s the kind of business model that theincumbent can’t adjust to; he just can’t bring his costs down. And even if hecan, philosophically he won’t, and he’ll move up market, and he’ll leave themarket to you. And that’s what happened to every one of them. And so mytheory was, why don’t we do the same thing in the underwriting market?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You’d read, or had you encountered Christensen?Hambrecht: I’d read his The Innovator’s Dilemma, and so forth, and then actually got toknow him, and he actually joined our board at W.R. Hambrecht.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You were impressed! Hambrecht: Yes, yes. Because I remember when I first read the book I thought, yes,intuitively that’s what I always thought had happened. I just had never thoughtit through to the point of being able to articulate it that way.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Put it in so many words.Hambrecht: Put it in those terms and make it so clear. Because I remember we started bothAdobe and Sybase, almost in the same month, in 1982. And they were bothvery successful, but they turned out very differently. Adobe is still just asdisruptive because they basically disrupted the printing industry. Sybase hadvery good technology. Most people thought they had better technology thanAdobe, but they had to compete with Larry Ellison at Oracle, and even thoughthey had a better product, Larry could keep adjusting. So Sybase built a decentbusiness because they never really had the dramatic difference in businessmodel.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It’s that term disruptive technology which Christensen’s changed todestructive innovation?Hambrecht: Disruptive innovation or disruptive business model is really what it is.Well, as I said, to me it made a lot of sense, and we developed our model atW.R. Hambrecht on that basis. And it has been a lot harder than I thought itwould be, because first of all, the IPO market has not been very good for thelast seven or eight years, so it has been a hard place to get any real traction.But secondly, we probably should have targeted a different market, becausethere’s something cultural about going public. It’s almost like a graduation ora wedding or something that.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: For a company, it is, isn’t it!Hambrecht: Yes, it is. And so people don’t deal with the economics of it the same waythey would any other business transaction. And they don’t really care about ituntil it’s all over. And what we found was countless people that came backlater and said, “Gee, I wish we’d done it your way!” [chuckling] Brand is soimportant, and boy the idea of Goldman Sachs being your underwriter, wow.And of course, Hambrecht & Quist—that’s what we built our business on, areputation that said, “Oh boy. This is the Good Housekeeping Seal ofApproval kind of thing. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, go back step by step and say how you did build this new company. Whowas there aside from you? Did you take some of the people from Hambrecht& Quist?Hambrecht: No, and the few I did was a mistake because it was so dramatically different,and it became very clear that anybody who’d been really with Hambrecht &Quist loved it and said why do it different? “Look at all the money we made,look at how successful we were.” The firm sold for $1.3 billion. Everybodywants to replicate the H&Q model, and this was very different.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How exactly did you put in material form this disruptive innovation businessmodel?Hambrecht: Well, we started with a small group of people, a couple of young people that Iknew that were intrigued with the idea of doing it different, hired my chieftechnology officer Alan Katz from Texas Instruments, because we had done ajoint venture with him at Hambrecht & Quist that had done very, very well,and I thought he was just one of the smartest guys I’d run into. And so, wesaid, okay, let’s do this different. You know what technology’s out there; let’sapply it differently. He was great. We went out there. I think we had a dozen people when we did our firstoffering, using the Internet to distribute and going out through Fidelity.Fidelity became an investor, a few other people, so we used everyone else’sdistribution. The original premise was that if we couldn’t figure out how to dosomething dramatically better with technology, don’t change it, just dosomething else, and focus all our energy and efforts on what we felt we couldbe doing. So we originally focused our efforts on the auction process. It tookabout a year. Most of it was dealing with the SEC, to develop a rule set thatthey were willing to live with. We patented it, which was very fortunate.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was the SEC initially skeptical?Hambrecht: I wouldn’t say skeptical. They were very careful about it because they wantedto make sure it wasn’t a system that could be gamed. But I think over a periodof time the SEC has been very constructive with us. It basically bringstransparency and economic benefit, and what it really does is it takes away thepower of allocation from the underwriter. And that’s at the very heart of anunderwriter’s leverage, the idea that he can either give you shares or not giveyou shares that are typically underpriced. I remember reading in one of thehistory books how J.D. Rockefeller used to get mad at J.P. Morgan because henever thought he got the proper allocation for the offering. [laughter] And Ithought, boy, they were playing the game even back then! <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: The older system is hardly democratic, is it?Hambrecht: Oh no. It’s basically an insider’s game, totally. And the underwriter keeps allthat leverage as they price it so advantageously so that their customer areessentially guaranteed a profit on the first day.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And H&Q was doing the same thing probably.Hambrecht: Sure, absolutely. I could take you through the whole history of it. Initially Ithink traditionally the idea of discounting a public offering, in other words,selling it at a price a little bit below where you thought the market was goingto open, was really a good thing, because what it did was you started out as awinner. For example, when we were doing our early deals at H&Q, if you solda deal to a mutual fund at say $10, and the stock went to $12 or $13, and youcame back to the market a year later to raise more money, they were morethan happy to put more money in because you were a winner in their portfolio.And you know, they’re in the business of advertising winners. If you were aloser, they’d sell you and stay out. So that’s really why it developed that way. Well, what happened in the nineties was, as it became clear or it was reallyclear that there would always be a discount, the big commission generators,like the big mutual funds, monetized it. So essentially what happened is that ifyou delivered a ten-point premium in the marketplace—let’s say you sold amillion shares of a company at $10 and it went to $20 (and that’s what washappening in the nineties on)—you were creating $10 million of aftermarketprofit for the buyers. That stock was placed with the big commissiongenerators, and what was happening was anywhere from a third to a half ofthat dollar amount came back to the managing underwriter that week incommission flow. It’s basically a kickback. So to me, that was a process thathad been taken over by the agenda of the underwriter. The underwriter’sagenda said, how do I get maximum profitability for me out of this system?And it did not place the stock with the right long-term players.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It was a money game, wasn’t it.Hambrecht: It was a money game. It was purely and simply a money game. So that’s whyI wanted to try it differently. We tried at Hambrecht & Quist to discipline thebuyers. If we knew somebody was flipping it the next day, we wouldn’t putthem in the next deal. It was a mess. You could never do it. The institutionshad too much buying power. So that’s when I decided the only way you couldever change it is in a totally new firm. 30<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, please explain how the auction system works.Hambrecht: Well, it’s called a Dutch auction. It’s not really. I remember going to theflower market in Amsterdam one time, and I think I probably misunderstoodwhat they were telling me, because ultimately it was Sergey Brin [Google cofounder] who said, “Hey, that’s not a Dutch auction. It’s a descending priceauction.” And what it is, is if you want to sell a million shares, everybodybids; you start with the highest bid, and you count down the number of sharestill you get to the last share you want to sell, to the millionth share. And theprice that that millionth share is bid becomes the clearing price for the wholeauction. So anybody who bid that price or higher gets the stock. Anybody whobid below that gets nothing. And of course, that’s what the bankers hatebecause they can no longer allocate to their best customers.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Where do the fees come in?Hambrecht: Well, we basically get paid a commission for selling the offering.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: At the same rate that you did at Hambrecht & Quist?Hambrecht: No, because we use electronic distribution, our costs are so much lower, weactually do it at lower spreads. So for example Google, when they wentpublic—the traditional spread is 7 percent, a 7 percent commission, which ispercent, and because we bid 2 percent, they negotiated 2.86 with everyoneelse. Well, for a big deal our fee will generally be 1.5 to 2 percent; for asmaller it may go as high as 3. But hey, that’s plenty of commission. Thatworks.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I read, though, that Google in the end didn’t go entirely with the auctionsystem. What was the story there?Hambrecht: Well, they did. No, they did. The compromise with Google was that two bulgefirms ran the process.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now, why?Hambrecht: Because this was the biggest, most sought after deal in fifty years, and theycouldn’t very well give it to a dinky little firm like ours, although I wish theyhad! [laughter] Eric Schmidt just wrote a really interesting article for the Harvard Business Review on the Google offering—five years later, five-yearanniversary. And we both think that Google didn’t get the optimum price, butGoogle didn’t really care. What Google cared about was did all of their usershave the opportunity to bid and get stock if they wished?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And they did.Hambrecht: And they did. And they did.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So there’s Google being Google again.Hambrecht: Google being Google. That’s exactly right. It’s a company with realprinciples, and they applied them to that underwriting process.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, now did you go after them? Or did they recognize that you were doingsomething different and come to you?Hambrecht: Well, a little of both. I had known Eric Schmidt before, and then it turned outthat Sergey Brin had an account with E*TRADE, which is one of ourdistribution partners, and he had bid on a number of our auctions. And don’tforget, the basis of Google’s economic model is an auction. So we didn’t haveto convince Sergey; we didn’t have to convince him that an auction was agood thing.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was that Google deal kind of like the Genentech and Apple deals? That here’sthis company that you’ve had a part in bringing to the public in a verydifferent way.Hambrecht: Right. It certainly—yes. Was it this dramatic turning point that everybodywent to us? No. It’s a tough business to crack. But yes, that was the one thatreally changed things. After that, the Morningstar IPO happened, and rightafter it—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because of Google?Hambrecht: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because they were impressed. Hambrecht: Joe Mansueto called—he was already on file with Morgan Stanley—and hesaid, “Can I do a Google thing?”<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It can’t be just ethics: let’s be fair and give everybody a chance. What are theyseeing is the financial upside of all this?Hambrecht: Well, it depends on the deal. For example, at Morningstar, I can take youthrough the whole numbers, but we delivered a check for $150 million toSoftbank, the selling shareholder, instead of $100 million. It was a huge, $50million difference.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is that because the fees are less?Hambrecht: Well, partially, but the lion’s share is in the pricing. See, the conventionalunderwriter will say, “You have to discount underneath where we think themarket’s going to be.” And they will always be very conservative about wherethey think the market will be. So the discounts become very deep.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yet, the people bidding—Hambrecht: The people bidding—it’s the market. Look, our auction is no different thanopening a stock every morning on the New York Stock Exchange. You findthe proper clearing price. So the price discovery is very accurate, veryeffective, and you don’t have to discount it, so it’s a big difference.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How is Wall Street accepting this today?Hambrecht: They still hate it, because as a result of the bubble and all the hearings withthe SEC, the kickback portion from mutual funds, I think, has pretty muchgone away. If it’s still there, it’s very subtle. But the hedge funds have becomeso important, and hedge funds are driven almost totally by performance. So tome, it’s no accident that the three strongest IPO brokers are also the threestrongest prime brokers for hedge funds. And see, hedge funds don’t have toreport—nobody—so they still discount the price, and their inside buyers,largely the hedge funds, still get the benefit of it. And they get the benefit ofcommission flow and everything else from the hedge funds. So it’s still thesame thing; it’s just not as obvious. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Are you happier now that you’re back, not quite where you started, but doingsomething closer to that? Hambrecht: You know, I started this thing on the idea that maybe in a year or two I’d turnit over to the young guys and move on, and it just turned out to be a lot harderand a lot longer than I thought. And I just felt I had to see it through. We’realmost to the point now where we’re getting acceptance. It’s been a slowmarket but things are starting to happen. We’ve developed a very goodelectronic trading business, because we don’t do any proprietary trading;we’re a pure agency shop. We’ve applied the same principles to electronictrading. So yes, we have a nice business building here now, and my daughter’shere now as a co-CEO. I’ve got a really good one in New York. So we’redeveloping a team now, and I’m hopeful over the next year or so I’ll fadeaway.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And your daughter Betsy [Elizabeth Hambrecht Eu] will take over?Hambrecht: Yes. And her partner or two. I’ve always believed in a partnership structure. Idecided early in the game, I never really liked to work for anybody. I like towork with people, and to me that’s why partnerships are so great. So we havea partnership here, and they need me less and less now. I think over the nextyear, because there’s enough momentum going I will be needed even less, buthope to stay active when they need me.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And do you think your daughter will carry on with your philosophy? Or is theworld changing, and she’s part of a younger generation, and it will evolvedifferently.Hambrecht: Well, she’s been very successful on her own. She went out to Hong Kongafter college and worked for Barings and then Goldman Sachs and was verysuccessful. Then she started an Internet portal out there, and then when shecame back here she ran Salon.com. She can do things a lot better than I can![laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, in certain areas, let’s say!Hambrecht: She can be successful at whatever she chooses to do.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: She doesn’t need Dad, you’re saying.Hambrecht: She doesn’t need me. Yes, I think we share a lot of the same philosophy andsense of how to do business and why to do business, but it’s going to be up toher. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But it must make you feel good to have somebody so close to you carry on.Hambrecht: Well, she’s earned it. It’s always hard with families and everything, but it’s alot easier with Betsy. I remember Dan Case used to say all the time saying,“Can’t you get Betsy to come back?” [chuckling] Because she was doinggreat. I said, “Well, we can’t afford her. Goldman pays too much.” But,anyway, very lucky.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I’d like to hear a little bit about what I just call the larger context, meaningwhat is there about this region that has nurtured so many wonderful high-techcompanies and continues to despite the recession.Hambrecht: Well, as you know, that debate is raised for a long time. I personally havealways thought that the intellectual climate of the Bay Area has been what’sreally done it. Having several great educational institutions and several bigearly technology pools of intellectual capability made it very unique. Andwhen you really look at what’s happened, so many of the people came out ofthose kind of sources. And then, you know, an infrastructure did developwhere you can find lawyers that know what to do; you can find people whocan raise you the money; you can bootstrap all kinds of things; and there’s atolerance for startups here that allows you to get going. So what came first? I don’t know. The technology world has been driven bywhat I would call intellectual property, and so whatever attracted it here in thefirst place is what caused it. People will say, we were just lucky to get[Sherman] Fairchild. Probably. For some reason or other he brought thirteenof the smartest people out here, and they populated the whole area!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That’s a different slant on intellectual property. It’s human minds rather thanthe patent document.Hambrecht: Right. Exactly.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What about the governmental/legislative environment as it has changedover— You came in the late fifties?Hambrecht: Right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Sixty years or so. Is there anything that pops out in your mind as beingparticularly helpful or not to the growth of this region and what you weredoing specifically? Hambrecht: Well, on the positive side, I think we’ve been very fortunate that we’ve hadsome political leaders that have understood what has really been happening inSilicon Valley and have adjusted to it. For example, Nancy Pelosi— PaulPelosi is a good friend, and we’ve known him forever. She really made a realattempt to understand what was happening down there and has been great. Somany of our elected people really get it. So it isn’t like you’re dealing withsomebody who’s still locked into the way things were done fifty years ago, ordefending an old, dying industry or anything like that. So I think we’ve beenlucky that way.On the negative side, I think some of the conservatism that’s set into this statehas hurt the educational system. And I think that’s really tragic. I find, forexample, it almost unbelievable that Berkeley and UCLA and places like thathave been able to maintain their excellence in the face of what’s happened. SoI just hope that ultimately we get back to— When I came out here in thefifties, I thought this was probably the best educational system in the country,from grade school on up through postdoc. It was, and it isn’t anymore.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: No, it’s not. And there’s our future.Hambrecht: The economy that we’ve developed out here requires educated people.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: We’re running out of time. Do you care to say anything about philanthropy?Hambrecht: Okay. Well, first of all, I think inherited wealth is probably not a great thing.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That’s your observation when it comes down to individuals?Hambrecht: Yes, I think it hurts individuals. And by the same token, a financial capabilityto go out to develop on your own and do what you want, that’s good too. Butseeing what Bill Gates and Warren Buffet have done, I think is a great thing.So what my wife and I decided to do, early, was try and think it through alittle bit more. I was busy so I said, “You do it.” And she’s gotten very good atit. She started Summer Search, along with two other people, which has been avery successful program to take inner-city kids and put them in a differentenvironment over the summer. They’ve had a great, great experience there.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Really! What kind of environment? Hambrecht: They’ll go on outdoor-type stuff. It’s been quite a successful program. Highnineties graduation rate from college for kids from totally dysfunctional,tough, inner-city backgrounds.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Fabulous.Hambrecht: We also founded the San Francisco Friends School. So it has been reallyschools.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Are you a Quaker?Hambrecht: Yes. And we’ve been reasonably aggressive about college scholarships andstuff like that. That’s where I got my break.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Very good. Is there any ending comment that you care to make?Hambrecht: No, except I wish I were twenty years younger! [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So you could start all sorts of enterprises?Hambrecht: Yes, I think right now there’s just a tremendous opportunity to do the H&Qthing all over again. All these good companies down there, and no one wantsto underwrite them because they’re too small. But that’s something you don’tget. [laughter] We haven’t figured that one out.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I really appreciate your time, and I thank you very much.Hambrecht: Thank you. Thank you.
