Interviewer: We’re in Mr. Bossen’s home, and it is July 8, 2010. Mr. Bossen is so far ourone and only entrepreneur in the venture capital series. Let’s start at thebeginning, namely where you were born and a little about the family that yougrew up in. Bossen: I grew up in Clinton, Iowa, where I was born January 9, 1927. My mother,Rose, and father August were a bit older than normal. My father was sixtywhen I was born, and my mother was thirty-seven, which was quite unusualfor those days. He had been and she had been something of entrepreneursthemselves. He had started a small chain of movie theaters in downstateIllinois. He founded them during the 1920s and sold them off in the early1930s.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Before the Depression. Bossen: Well, the Depression had started in 1930, (and he got out) but it was notharming the movies, strangely enough. It was a great escape place, and it costten cents to get a ticket in those days. But then my dad died when I was twelveyears old.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you know how they came to be in the theater business. Bossen: A little bit. Dad had owned a jewelry store and was a watchmaker prior tothat, and my mother was a professional musician. She was an organist. Sheplayed the largest pipe organ in the world, which is still in existence at theChicago theater. Before talkies came in, they had the organ playing along withthe film, and she played that big pipe organ. I don’t know how they met, butthey were together in the 1920s in Chicago, and they were married, I think, inthe early twenties.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So you are an only child. Bossen: I am an only child.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What was it like growing up in that family?. Bossen: Well, after my dad died, my mother and I moved in with her mother, mygrandmother. And her sister, my aunt, was also there. So I was raised in amatriarchal society from age [chuckling] eleven or twelve and thereafter.Clinton, Iowa was a great place, as I look back on it, to have a childhood andgrow up. It was on the Mississippi River. It was a mile wide at that point, andwe would go out fishing. We weren’t supposed to, but we went swimming inthe Mississippi.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Weren’t supposed to because it was dangerous. Bossen: Yes, well, that was the theory. And in fact, I had a cousin who drowned in it, asecond cousin. But it was a good place to grow up. We lived in the northernend of Clinton, in what originally was a separate town called Lyons, Iowa, andthen it merged into Clinton sometime in there. We had small schools becausewe were in that end of town. I think we had about sixty in my graduatingclass.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And this was a public school. Bossen: Oh yes. I graduated in June of 1945, and of course World War II was still hotand heavy, so all of the young men, boys, went in the service right away. Iwent in the Marine Corps and stayed there for one year, and from the marinesI got a fleet appointment to the Naval Academy.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, step back a minute, please, because I’m interested in what thisentrepreneurial streak in the family might have meant to you. Bossen: I never really thought about it. [chuckling] But I think it gave me the ambitionto strike out on my own.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did your mother continue to work after your father died. Bossen: Oh yes. Yes, she just became a clerk in the store. They ultimately lost most oftheir money.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because of the Depression? Or was it more complicated. Bossen: It was more complicated. They were swindled, but they had managed to keepit through the crash. One of my mother’s sisters was going with a guy inWashington. She was living there. He had this idea that he knew where they were going to build the George Washington Bridge, and if you knew where itwas going to be built, you could buy the land on the approaches, and it wouldgreatly increase in value. So this fellow got a lot of people to give him moneyto buy up the options on the land where he “knew” it was going to be built. Itturned out he was right. The problem was, he hadn’t invested the money inthat. He’d spent it on fast women and slow horses. [<|endoftext|>
Interviewer chuckles] So myparents and a lot of other people lost a lot of money with Uncle Charlie.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So that was the reason for your mother getting the sales position. Bossen: Yes, right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were you becoming interested in any particular field as you went throughschool. Bossen: Well, besides my mother, a woman who had a very large influence on me washer sister, whose name before she was married was Carolyn Nichols, and aftershe was married, Carolyn Eberhart. She married a guy named Bill Eberhartwho was a marvelous guy. He was a finance guy, and he did quite well inmanaging the financial operations of some corporations. She got me interestedin management, because she ultimately became one of the first successfulwomen executives in manufacturing. In fact, there was a big article on her inthe Chicago Tribune in the early forties—about her accomplishments as awoman executive. She became vice president of manufacturing in a companycalled Climax Engineering, in Clinton, Iowa. And Climax Engineering madebig V-12 oilfield diesel engines. It was big, heavy equipment stuff, and theyhad a big foundry and machine shop and the rest of it there, and she managedthis.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Very unusual for a woman. Bossen: Well, she started out as a secretary and worked for the guy who was CEO.Then World War II came along, and a lot of the men went in the service, andshe was left there, and she was doing it, so she ultimately, as I said, becamevice president of manufacturing. Bill Eberhart, her husband, was the VP offinance for the company, and that’s how they got together. She pushed me andincented me to get into management training.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And. Bossen: Well, I left the Naval Academy after three years. I didn’t finish. I banged myknee up plebe year playing football, and by second-class year I was not getting around in the obstacle course too well. So they called me in and said,“Bossen, we’re going to have to operate on that knee, but we have to tell youregardless whether we do or not that you can go ahead and graduate, but youwon’t get a line commission. You’ll have to serve in the supply corps.”<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because of the injury. Bossen: Yes. Well, line officers in the marine corps have to be able to charge up hillsand stuff like that. They told me that, so I said, “Thanks. I’m out of here.”<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why had you entered Annapolis in the first place. Bossen: I got a fleet appointment from the marines.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What does that mean. Bossen: Well, you get into the academy in a couple of different ways. First of all,every senator and representative can appoint one person a year into theacademy, I think. I don’t know how it works exactly. And the second way is,the navy and the marine corps can appoint a certain number, and these arecalled fleet appointments. At that point I was stationed at Philadelphia NavyYard and going to radio op[eration]s school for the marines. And Saturdaynight we were doing a big cleanup for the colonel’s inspection the next day,and they had posted a notice that anyone who wanted to be considered to go tothe Naval Academy prep school should, as they say, lay below and see thecaptain. So I did that. It was better than washing windows, I thought. And hebasically said, “Well, you look like you’ve got the right stuff.” I had scoredvery well on the basic test that they give everyone who goes in the service. Itused to be called the AGCT [Army General Classification Test], and I don’tremember what those initials stand for.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was it like the current SAT. Bossen: Yes, it was. Well, they were not trying to look at knowledge; they were tryingto look at intelligence. So I got sent down to the Naval Academy prep school,where the service sent their enlisted people so that they could take the test,which was very much like the SAT—an entrance exam for the academy. I hadnever had chemistry in high school. They didn’t offer it in Lyons, Iowa. Theywere teaching us basic chemistry in this class, but I was only in it for about amonth so I didn’t pick up much, and then the exam came along. Some of theanswers were perfectly obvious, so I answered the ones that I could. The rest of them I marked the C column all the way down, and it passed! [laughter] Sowhen in doubt, say C!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: A lesson early learned. Bossen: Yes, so that’s how I got in the academy. And when I left the academy, I wentto MIT.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It was an honor, of course, to be at Annapolis. Bossen: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you just take it in stride that you weren’t going to graduate. Bossen: Oh yes. Sure. No question.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why MIT? How did that come about. Bossen: Well, I applied to two schools, Yale and MIT. I was admitted to both, and Iwanted to go to Yale because my girlfriend was at Vassar, and that was veryconvenient to New Haven. [chuckling] But dear Aunt Carrie, who I mentionedearlier said, “Well, you of course can go where you want to go, but if youwant any help from me, you’d better go to MIT because you’re a poor boy,and you have to make a living afterward, and those Yale kids are all prettywell off.” That’s why I went to MIT.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: MIT in those days pulled from a diverse social system. Bossen: Oh yes.The course I went into was initially called business and engineeringadministration—a horrible name. And while I was there, they changed thename to the School of Industrial Management. And a couple of years later,they changed it again to the Sloan School of Management because Mr. Sloanhad by that time given them the money, so he had a school named for him.[laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] Were you thinking at this point more about a business career asopposed to an engineering career?. Bossen: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And why was that. Bossen: I just thought I would enjoy management more than I would enjoy designingvalves, for example.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But the fact that you were in that business course didn’t preclude takingtechnical courses. Bossen: Well, of course I had three years at the Naval Academy, which was largelyengineering.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And that was your choice? Or that’s just what happened when you went toAnnapolis. Bossen: The only elective that you had then was language.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Really. Bossen: And I took Russian. The reason I chose Russian was that about half of myclass had already had two years of college before they entered the NavalAcademy, and they had all taken a couple of years of German or French orSpanish or something. I thought, I will be smart; I will take Russian becauseno one will have had that, and I’ll start out even. Big mistake. I walked in thefirst day in class, and there were a whole bunch of White Russian descendantsthere, jabbering away! [chuckling] But I’ve always been glad that I’ve taken itbecause it was interesting.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I didn’t realize that there was such a strong emphasis on engineering atAnnapolis. Bossen: Oh yes. Both that and West Point. They’re basically engineering schools.Now, subsequently, ten maybe fifteen years ago, I don’t know when they didit, but they broadened it out so that now you could get liberal arts degreesthere as well as engineering, and you could major in fine arts and things likethat. I don’t understand why they did it. A naval officer aboard ship needs toknow engineering a lot more than he needs to know about Plato. [chuckling] <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What happened at MIT? You took basically business courses, right. Bossen: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: People speak of Harvard’s case method way of teaching. Bossen: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is there something characteristic about what became the Sloan School. Bossen: Yes, they use cases, but it’s not like Harvard.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And did it serve you in good stead. Bossen: Yes, very good.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: In what sorts of ways. Bossen: I learned about marketing. Before I went there, I thought marketing was thefarmer is taking his eggs to market. [laughter] And so I had marketing, and thefinance courses were very good, and I even took a cost accounting course,which was very helpful.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So you did have some leeway in your course selection. Bossen: Oh yes, at MIT you did have selection.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was there some competition with Harvard. Bossen: Probably.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But you weren’t worried about that. Bossen: No.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you make connections there that later served you well?. Bossen: Yes, with a couple of the professors. And of course I had friends in the studentbody, but I don’t recall anything coming about with former students.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were you taking all this in your stride? MIT is a rigorous place. Bossen: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You didn’t have any difficulty fitting in and doing the work. Bossen: No. I made dean’s list right away. In fact, in many ways, I found the NavalAcademy more difficult academically than MIT. But I think it was because ofthe courses I was taking and my background when I got there.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because you’d come straight from high school. Bossen: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And you were probably the real exception there. Bossen: Well, straight from high school and from a small Iowa high school.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: None of this was intimidating. Bossen: I was concerned about doing the work, but I felt I could do it, and I did it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And you obviously could. You made dean’s list.Can you summarize the approach that the predecessor of the Sloan Schooltook? Was it a very hands-on kind of education. Bossen: Well, I would contrast it with the Naval Academy. At the Naval Academy,most courses you recited every day. You had a reading assignment for thatday, lecture, and then they would say, “Man the boards.” You would go to theblackboard, and there’d be a slip there with four questions on it, and you hadto write the answers to those four questions on the blackboard. And if you gotthree of them right you passed, and if you got less than three right, you failed![laughter] Very simple. So you had to keep up. You were doing it daily. AtMIT, it was, we don’t care if you ever come to class. You just have to pass the exams. And it was totally a different situation. But I think, because I had theNaval Academy background, I did the work day by day, didn’t get behind.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, tell me what happens after you graduated from MIT. Bossen: I got a job with Alcoa at their new rolling mill in Davenport, Iowa. And thereason I took that job was that my mother was getting on, and she was inClinton, Iowa, which was nineteen miles away. So I could live at home withher and drive back and forth to Davenport Works. So I was with Alcoa for sixmonths, and I was terminally bored. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What were you doing. Bossen: Industrial engineering.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What was boring about it. Bossen: Well, Alcoa was a fine company but very bureaucratic, and if I’d stayed withthem thirty years, I might have made a plant manager someplace, or industrialengineering director, but it was just too bureaucratic. And about this time,after I was there six months, I got a call from a good friend from MIT, whodid help me. In fact, he got me out of Alcoa and into a small startup inColumbus, Ohio that was called Industrial Nucleonics, doing the peacetimeatom and all that stuff. His name was Karl Cooperrider, and he got me outthere, and I interviewed with him, and they offered me a job, and I took a jobas their first manager of market research.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Wow. At what age. Bossen: Well, it was a very small company, you understand. It was a startup. Igraduated in ’51—that would have been ’52—twenty-five.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now, did he know that you were dissatisfied at Alcoa. Bossen: No. He just called me up one day and said, “Hey, we’ve got this opportunityout here, and I thought about you. Why don’t you come out and meet us?” SoI got in the car and drove out and saw him. I was married at this point, and mywife thought this was the most marvelous thing that had ever happened—gother out of Clinton, Iowa! [chuckling] Columbus, Ohio sounded like a real city.She was from LA originally. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, she knew there was another world. Bossen: Yes, a different world. So that’s how I got with Industrial Nucleonics.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What were you seeing at Industrial Nucleonics other than a way of gettingaway from Alcoa. Bossen: I thought it was a great opportunity because they were developing sensorbased control systems, analog. They developed systems to measure, forexample, the thickness of— Well, I came from Alcoa, so aluminum while it’sbeing rolled, without touching it. You shot beta rays through it from a nuclearisotope, and you could measure the thickness directly without touching it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was that new? Had Alcoa been using. Bossen: No, they had not been. This was new. This all came out after World War II,and isotopes became available. Radioisotopes were not available before thattime.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That’s interesting because the AEC [Atomic Energy Commission] was prettymuch controlling the distribution of radioisotopes at that time. Bossen: They were, yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So was Industrial Nucleonics buying its radioisotopes from the AEC. Bossen: Yes. But then we had other companies that would take the radioisotope itselfand encapsulate it. Very dangerous stuff. If you ingested any strontium-90, forexample, it’s a bone seeker and causes bone cancer in you ultimately.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And did you know all that? Was the hazard of radioisotopes known at thetime. Bossen: Yes—oh, that was well known, well known. But we never handled the rawisotopes there. Nor did we later at Measurex. We bought—we acquired themfrom the AEC, and they shipped them to a supplier company. One was U.S.Radium. They specialized in taking the isotopes and putting them inhermetically sealed capsules. So then we only handled the capsules. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Which were impenetrable to whichever the radiation was. Bossen: No, no! You want the radiation to come out. That’s how you use it!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Okay, well how are you protecting yourself then? I thought this was a safetything. Bossen: [indicating with sheets of paper] That much paper will stop beta rays totally.They are not very penetrative. Gamma rays are a different kettle of fish.Depending on the energy of the gamma ray, they can be quite penetrating. Butno, if you understand how this works, it isn’t a problem. You design theequipment so that the radioactive source is just in the small source unit andwell shielded, and directly above it you put the detector, and generally you fixit so people can’t even put their fingers in between. And even if you did, youwouldn’t get any serious effect from the beta rays unless you left your fingersthere for a very long time.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How did the AEC transport its radioisotopes. Bossen: They transported them in lead-lined containers. You would do this work underhoods, glass-covered hoods, that would have a negative pressure, so thatnothing comes out.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But Industrial Nucleonics wasn’t doing that. Bossen: No. They were only handling sealed sources. Industrial Nucleonics was usinganalog computers and analog controls to make the measurements and controlsystems that then, when I founded Measurex, we did digitally. I stayed atIndustrial Nucleonics for fifteen years.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, don’t go too fast. [chuckling. Bossen: Sorry.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It seems to me that Industrial Nucleonics is a starting point for what you’regoing to spend much of your life doing. Bossen: Yes. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So what were you doing at Industrial Nucleonics. Bossen: I started, as I said, in market research, and then I went into sales, and I cameout here to California and opened up the entire West Coast market. We wereselling these systems to companies like Kaiser Aluminum and U.S. Steel. Isold thirty-five systems, I think, to U.S. Steel in Pittsburg, California, formeasurement in steel rolling mills and classifying lines and electrolytictinning lines. In any sheet process, we could measure the weight per unit area,and that correlates to thickness. Well, basically, paper making was a very bigsheet processing industry, and we started out just measuring basis weight andthen ultimately the moisture content.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now you’re still talking about Industrial Nucleonics. Bossen: Yes, they were doing that. I think we came out in 1958 with the onlinemoisture-measuring device. You see, paper is basically wood fiber and water.And a sheet of paper in a reasonable environment will equilibrate tosomething like 6 percent water and 94 percent fiber. And when you’re makingthe paper, before they had these systems that we developed, they had quite abit of variation. You take a sheet of paper coming out of a machine today, andit’s thirty feet wide, and it’s moving at sixty miles an hour, and you can’ttouch it with a sensor. So we developed the systems, initially at IndustrialNucleonics, using analog methods for a control system. And this worked, butnot as well as it could have. So when the minicomputer came along.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: When would that have been. Bossen: That would have been in the mid-sixties to late sixties. The founders atIndustrial Nucleonics, Bert [Wilbert E.] and Roy Chope, were analog peopleand developed vacuum tube circuits and this sort of thing. They weren’t surethe transistor was here to stay, let alone the integrated circuit.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why would they think that. Bossen: People who are brought up in a given technology, and they spend their liveslearning that technology, are not really interested in jumping into a differenttechnology.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see. But were you paying attention?. Bossen: Yes. I said to them, “Look, we can use a digital computer, and we caneliminate all of this analog circuitry, and we can use the computer, not only tosupport the measurements, but for the controls and the displays and the rest ofit.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now how could you know that? Was your engineering education sufficient sothat you could understand what was going on in the computer world. Bossen: Yes, sure. I kept up. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How? By reading. Bossen: Reading, living, looking, learning.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because the development of the computer is a whole thing. Bossen: The computer was developed, the hardware was developed. We developed thesoftware.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: These were the very early days of the application of the computer, right. Bossen: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: In any form. I’m certainly not an expert on computer history, but it seems tome that not that long before that, the computer was almost an experimentaldevice. Bossen: No, that was well accepted in industry. In the sixties, IBM was—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh, I thought we were still in the fifties.was when the digital minicomputer came out.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, but when you first arrived at Industrial Nucleonics [in 1951] thecomputer must have been a very new application.. Bossen: Well, it was all analog in those days.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But even so. Bossen: Well, yes, but people had been building analog controls for years and yearsand years before that.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: All right. A company such as U.S. Steel would be interested in a sensor devicelargely to make sure that its products were consistent. Bossen: To make money!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, yes, but how? [chuckling. Bossen: Okay. Let’s go to the paper industry. Back to that.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: All right. Bossen: Ninety-four percent fiber/6 percent water. Now the paper, in fact, in the precomputer-control days for the paper industry, standard newsprint weighedthirty-two pounds per ream. That meant thirty-two pounds per three thousandsquare feet. Today about twenty-eight pounds per three thousand square feet isstandard newsprint. Did you know that had changed?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Of course not. And what is the significance. Bossen: All right. Well, do you why it changed? The reason is that it varied so much asit was being manufactured, that some of it was made down here at twentyeight pounds and some of it was made up here at thirty-six pounds per ream.What we did when we had the measurement tools online, and we were able tocontrol both the machine direction and cross direction, we narrowed thatspread down to plus or minus a couple of tenths of a pound. So if it was okayat twenty-eight pounds before, some of it was—whoosh—we’ll just shift it alldown there. You couldn’t do that before because it would have gone too far.So that enabled the paper companies to save—four over thirty-two is eight—12-½ percent of their fiber.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So it was a cost saver as well as a consistency regulator.. Bossen: Of course, of course! And also, you could run the paper machine fasterbecause you didn’t have so much water to evaporate. Paper starts out as aslurry. Coming out of a headbox it may be one half of 1 percent fiber and 99-½ percent water. And then it is drained through a wire, and it gets to be about60 percent fiber. Then it goes into a big string of dryer cans, that may be a cityblock long, that runs over them, and it boils out the rest of the water. So ifyou’re running it lighter, you have less water to evaporate, so you can run itfaster. And that’s how it works in the paper industry. Now in the steelindustry, you get the same kind of situation, and your rolling mill is limited inspeed. So if I can narrow that down and produce it lighter, I can move itfaster. So you’re both saving raw material, and you’re improving yourproductivity.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And that was your sales message. Bossen: Yes, sure! Well, that was the sales thing back at Industrial Nucleonics, wholater changed their name, by the way, to AccuRay Corp. And at Measurex,that’s how we sold our systems. We showed the user—the rolling milloperator, the paper machine operator, ceiling tile operator, what have you—that they could produce a more uniform product, which made their customershappy. And they could save money because they could produce it in the lowerhalf of the tolerance band, and they could run it faster.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now was Industrial Nucleonics selling to these various industries. Bossen: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: To a wide range. Bossen: Not quite as wide as it became. But yes, pretty wide, yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And so you were dealing with all those different industries. Bossen: Customers—yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Which must have been an education in itself. Bossen: Oh sure! <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And you liked that! [chuckling. Bossen: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I suspected. All right. Well, you were at Industrial Nucleonics a long time,weren’t you. Bossen: I was there fifteen years. I ultimately became VP, general manager. And as Isaid, when the minicomputer came along, and I couldn’t get the two foundersto seriously consider it, I left, came out to California, was introduced to someof the venture capital people here.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Before you leave Industrial Nucleonics: the two founders of IndustrialNucleonics were happy with the analog and wouldn’t switch. Bossen: Yes, yes. They didn’t view the minicomputer either as a threat or anopportunity, and it was both, of course.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, and that was really the reason that you left. Bossen: Yes. Besides, I wanted to come back to California. In 1967, when I wasmaking that move, digital minicomputers were just really getting going. Butthere were more people who knew about them in Santa Clara County thanthere were in the whole state of Ohio.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I’ll bet. Well, who were those people and companies? Was it IBM and. Bossen: Yes. One of the co-founders with me of Measurex was a scientist from IBM.His name was Eric Dahlin, and he was a Swede who had come over to thiscountry in the fifties and ultimately went to work for IBM San Jose. He wasworking on computer-control systems with big IBM computers.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That were meant to do what you have been describing. Bossen: Similar things, yes. But they were too big and too complicated and tooexpensive. So when the minicomputer came along, boy, he just dove into thatwith me! [chuckling] He just loved it because he could do what he wanted to. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And at that point he left. Bossen: He left IBM and joined me at Measurex. Another founder was a guy namedGene Anderson. He had been with a small company; I can’t think of theirname, doing a lot of work for Nasa Ames Lab. Eric was the software guy;Gene was the hardware guy. We got together and put together a team. I startedraising the venture capital.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So you arrived in California essentially without a job. Bossen: Exactly without a job! [laughter] And I had a wife and four children back inOhio.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So you must have been pretty fed up with the founders of IndustrialNucleonics. Bossen: Yes, I was, but beyond that it was more the opportunity that I saw. If theyweren’t going to do it, and I knew we could do this—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now this was before Silicon Valley had a name. But you knew that this wasan innovative region. Bossen: Oh yes, yes. This was well known at the time.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, anybody who was doing the kind of work that you were doing. Bossen: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So that was a magnet. Bossen: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you end up in what is now Silicon Valley? Is that where you landed. Bossen: Yes, Santa Clara.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That’s pretty good.. Bossen: Well, that’s where we put our first office and development center. We openedthe doors on January 19, 1968.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, start back a little bit earlier than that. From the way you’re telling it, orat least the way I’m receiving it, you didn’t even have the idea for Measurexdo you. Bossen: Oh yes. Yes, I did. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You’re going to do what Industrial Nucleonics was doing using digital. Bossen: And I’m going to use the digital computer. Yes, that’s exactly why I came outhere!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see, okay. Well then, how did you go about it? You get to Santa Clara, andthen what do you do. Bossen: When we opened our doors; we had twelve employees—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But you have to have money first. Bossen: Yes, that’s right. I had raised the venture capital. I raised $1.3 million ofventure capital.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: From whom and why were they interested. Bossen: Well, the first person I talked to, and I was introduced to him by the guy fromChicago at William Blair & Company, Ed Blair, who had been all along themajor investor in Industrial Nucleonics. We got along pretty well. When I left,he gave me a letter of introduction to a number of the people out here, andamong them was Bill Draper, so I met Bill Draper. Their company was SutterHill Capital. Paul Wythes was there. Bill has gone on to other companies andother venture capital.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did they immediately grasp the importance of what you wanted to do. Bossen: Well, the first thing that happened was we liked each other. We looked aroundat companies that they might invest in that I might manage, and we didn’t find any. I said, “Well, maybe we ought to look at doing this,” and I put together abusiness plan for them for Measurex. I remember Bill told me, “Yes, do abusiness plan but keep it to seven pages.” And his reasoning was, he said,“Venture capitalists get many business plans, and they’re fifty, sixty, ahundred pages long, full of projections for twenty years. None of it’smeaningful.” [chuckling] He said, “Now, if I’m going to take something hometo read at night, am I going to take the one that’s seven pages long or the onethat’s this thick? I’ll take the one that’s seven pages as long as it tells thestory.” Well, I did the text in seven, but I did have one more page of aspreadsheet. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now was venture capital financing a familiar entity to you. Bossen: No, but I learned about it pretty quickly. [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Of course it was the very early days of venture capital as we know it today. Bossen: Yes, I guess it was as we know it today. There had been a number of thembefore—Draper, Gaither & Anderson was one.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Draper, Gaither & Anderson, as I remember it, was founded in 1968. Bossen: Earlier, no earlier. [The correct date is 1959.][End Audio File 1]million, and that was considered a jumbo. That was a big investment! Theykept saying, “Can’t you do it for $50,000?” [chuckling] But now they go outand raise $40-$50 million on a startup. What’s going on here?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, it’s a different world. [technical interruption]So you needed some money, and you met Bill Draper. Bossen: I met Bill Draper and Bill’s partner Paul Wythes, and they decided that theywere gong to back me. But they didn’t have enough to do it themselves inthose days, so they said, “Well, we’re going to help you raise the rest of the 20venture capital.” So they went around with me, Paul Wythes in particular, andvisited with a lot of the other venture capitalists, who ultimately came into thedeal. Reid Dennis was one. His wife actually made an investment herself.In fact, let me digress. We had a party at, I think, the twenty-fifth anniversaryof the founding of Measurex. We had sold it by that time, but we included allof the original investors and the original twelve people. Pete Bancroft was sortof acting as emcee, and he went around and said, “Did any of you keep yourentire Measurex investment until the company was sold?” And the answerwas no, none of them had except one person, and that was Peggy Dennis.[chuckling] I asked her, “Well, why did you keep it? “Well, it was doing well.I didn’t see any reason to change.” So she made something like fifty to one onher original investment because she just kept it and held on! The typical VC,when they get something and it’s going good, they will sell off enough to gettheir nut back and then go on, which probably is the professional thing to do. But anyway, Paul Wythes took me around, and we met, as I said, PeteBancroft, and Pete was the largest original investor. When he came in, thatpretty much guaranteed that ultimately we were going to get enough of the$1.3 million. There was a so-called group of guys—Dan McGanney, BillEdwards, John Bryan—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Pitch Johnson. Bossen: Pitch was not an original investor.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you—pitch him? [chuckling. Bossen: No, we never did. I don’t know why. I think, if my memory serves me right,he was traveling or something in Europe during the time that we were raisingthe fund. I’ve spent a lot of time with Pitch subsequently on various things. Idon’t know if I’ve left anybody out.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, you can think about it. Bossen: So we raised the money.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You raised it easily and quickly. Bossen: Well, in hindsight, I guess you could say that. But at the time, it didn’t seemlike it. We started making the pitch in August of ’67, and we didn’t close on it until January of ’68. So we spent all of that time, and I was flying all over thecountry. It wasn’t just here, see.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Had you saved some money. Bossen: Me?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes. What were you living on in this period. Bossen: I had saved $80,000, and that’s what we were living on.I went to Boston, talked to venture capitalists up there, none of whominvested. Or maybe one of them did. But anyway, their view was, “That’sawfully risky, developing that new digital technology,” et cetera, et cetera.“Why don’t you just copy what Industrial Nucleonics did, and gradually youcan get into it?” I said, “No.” So they said it was too risky. The San Franciscoventure capitalists, on the other hand, said, “Gee, this doesn’t seem very farout at all! It’s not a new transistor.” [chuckling] That was the differencebetween the San Francisco VCs and the Boston VCs.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you consider yourself a good interpreter of technology. Bossen: Maybe. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, Bill Draper and Pete Bancroft don’t have technical backgrounds. Sohow did you explain to them what you want to do with this digital sensorapparatus. Bossen: I had made up a few visual aids. With Pete, I recall when we were havinglunch at his club in New York, I drew on a napkin, putting the computer at thecenter of the network and having it support the sensors and the controls andthe digital displays and all of that together. And he always refers to thefamous napkin. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: There are so many entrepreneurs that start with a napkin. [chuckling. Bossen: Yes. But you see, I didn’t try to explain the bits and bytes to the VCs. I triedto explain the end result—what we were trying to do, and why this wasimportant to the end user. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was Measurex always going to be focused on paper. Bossen: Well, no, that was only one of the things that we were focusing on. We werefocused on the entire gamut of sheet process industries—plastic film, forexample. Paper was our biggest industry simply because the economics wereso outstanding for the paper companies, and it was such a big market. Therewere, we thought, about five thousand paper machines of adequate size thatcould support the system. And we sold the systems for $150,000 to beginmillion per system.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, maybe first we should get an actual physical building for this company.So where did you start out. Bossen: Santa Clara. We rented the building that was a brand new little spec buildingpeople were putting up down there. It had 13,000 square feet. And we said,“Well, we don’t need that much. All we need is about half that much.” So theguy said, “Okay.” And he said, “ I don’t want any of your stock. I want you topay me in cash.” Big mistake! [chuckling] But anyway, we did, and thenwithin nine months we knew we needed more space, so we took the other halfof the building from him. And we stayed there—the address was 330 MathewStreet. And that was just a little tilt-up building then. We knew— and wewanted to—that we had to move, and we looked around for other space andfound it in Cupertino.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: More space because you needed more space. Bossen: Yes, more space because yes, we sure needed it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Within what time period. Bossen: We bought the space in Cupertino in 1970. We found a beautiful plot. Myformer wife Doris Stephens, who’s now deceased, was our first HR [humanresources] person. She had a doctorate in counseling psych. [chuckling] Sheworked for us for a while, and she found the space.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now this is the woman who had been in LA. Bossen: Yes, whom I met in Poughkeepsie at Vassar. Anyway, she located the space,and it belonged to a nice little old lady, who I suppose has passed away now, by the name of Blanche B. Woelffel. She owned thirty-five acres inCupertino, and she had a factory there that produced tomato paste. She had anevaporator and one big building, and she was growing tomatoes and plums onthis property.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You certainly have a lot of entrepreneurial women in your life. Bossen: [chuckling] Well, she had inherited it from her husband who had just died.She sold it to us, and we paid an exorbitant amount, I thought—$50,000 anacre for the first— I think we had thirteen acres originally.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And you thought you needed that much. Bossen: Well, thought we would.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So you were looking ahead. Bossen: So we bought it, and then we started building. We started out, and we built afifty-thousand square-foot office and factory, and then we added fiftythousand, then we added a hundred thousand, then we added another hundredthousand as it went on. But anyway, that’s how we came to be there inCupertino, and then we sold the company to Honeywell in 1997.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh, well, don’t go that fast! [chuckling. Bossen: Well, I was just going to mention one thing. They sold off that property for$50 million. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh my heavens. Bossen: Right after they bought us. I’d have done better had I just bought the land andsat there and done nothing and then sold it! [laughter] That’s why there are somany millionaire developers around.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: All right. So we’ve got an edifice, or we’ve now got two edifices—you’vealready outgrown one. What about people? You’ve mentioned thetechnologist/scientist from IBM. Who else came early on? And where werethey coming from, and what were they supposed to do?. Bossen: Oh, well, we hired a lot of physicists. Physicists are necessary in the sensorbusiness. They understand how beta rays and gamma rays interact withmatter. We needed non-contact sensors. We started out with one sensor, abasis-weight sensor or a thickness sensor which I described to you earlier.And then we developed a moisture sensor using infrared radiation.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How would that work. Bossen: Well, infrared radiation was generated from a little light bulb. We shone thatthrough the paper, and infrared radiation at 1.92 microns is strongly absorbedby water, so we built a very good infrared-based moisture sensor. People hadbuilt them before. We were not unique in that, but no one had built a good onebefore, and we built a really good one, thanks to a key physicist that we hadhired whose name is John Howarth. We were still down in the Santa Clara office, and we decided that we needed aphysics technician to help Eric Dahlin with his development. So we advertisedfor one. I’m sitting in my office on a Friday afternoon, late, and Eric comes in,and he said, “Dave, I think you ought to come meet this fellow.” I said, “Thisis the physics technician?” And he said, “Well, he’s a little bit more thanthat.” And it turns out he was an English physicist. I don’t know if youremember, but there was a recession in the defense industries in 1970, and hehad been laid off from Lockheed, and his present job was repainting the papermachine. [chuckling] So he came in, and I talked to him for a few minutes,and Eric said, “I think we ought to hire him.” I said, “Well, it’s up to you. Ifyou want to use him as a technician that’s fine. And we only have a budget forone.” Well, of course, we hired him. Then a month later we had to hiretechnicians for both of them! [chuckling] But that worked out. John made a key invention for us—we patented it and it made all of thedifference in the world, and it was called infinite random scattering. Peoplehad made, as I said, moisture gauges before by shooting infrared radiationthrough it paper and detecting it on the other side. And in order to get a lot ofsignals, say you want to measure a light piece of paper, like tissue paper. Theradiation just zips right through it, and you don’t get enough attenuation to geta decent signal even in that 1.9 micron range. So—his name was JohnHowarth, and John came up with this idea. He said, “Well, why don’t we dothis: we’ll take two diffuse glass plates.” (It looks like ivory glass in color; it’sdiffuse.) “We’ll put one on the top sensor and one under the bottom one. Thenwe’ll shoot the beam up here, and we’ll let it bounce back and forth manytimes, and then we’ll detect it over here. Well, that meant that the beam wentthrough the piece of paper an infinite number of times, so we basically made athin piece of paper look thick. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Would that constitute amplification of the signal. Bossen: Inherently, yes, but of course we had amplifiers on the electronics outside ofthat. So that was a key invention, and nobody had ever thought of that before.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was that the first sensor for moisture content. Bossen: Yes. The same physicist came up with another idea, and we made a colorsensor. Paper, plastics, many materials, color is a very important thing. Therewere laboratory color sensors, but there was nothing that was good online. Sohe invented a good online color sensor as well.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Would that work under that same system. Bossen: No. Different principle. You shot straight through for color, and you also usedreflectants for color.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It would work for any color that you wished. Bossen: Any color that you wished. And you defined the color.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: These inventions allowed you to move into different industries, right. Bossen: Oh yes. We did a lot in the plastics industry—any sheet-process industry.Then ultimately we got back into fluid processing by developing some gammaray sensors to measure the liquid density of stuff in a pipe.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now are the radioactive materials still coming from the AEC. Bossen: Yes. Actually, we were buying some— The most useful radioisotope forlightweight sheet materials, like paper and aluminum foil and things like that,is krypton-85. It’s very useful because it emits a very low-energy beta particle.I think we were getting some through the USAEC, but I think we were gettingmore from England. I think they had a thing like our AEC, but they weredoing more to develop some of the isotopes for industrial use. And we gotsome from Canada—oh yes, Chalk River in Canada. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you think the different agencies that were early on in the isotope makingand distribution business deliberately tried to make their products distinctive. Bossen: No, I don’t think so. These were a bunch of scientists and—oh, here’s anisotope. Let’s make it, and maybe somebody will find a use for it. [chuckling]. Bossen: Where are we here?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, you’ve just developed a color sensor. Bossen: Oh, well, we developed many sensors for different purposes. We ultimatelywound up with a dozen or more sensors, but this was after we were going. Ishowed you that annual report. Some of it’s in there. I’ve got other annualreports. Every year they’re showing more products and sensors comingthrough.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Your physicists came up with new products. Bossen: Basically yes. Physicists are the guys who are cranking the stuff out.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And how does that work? Are they saying, “We can make the technology tobe able to sense x, y, z.” Or are you or they saying, “There’s an industry overhere which could use a device that told you x. Can you develop somethingthat will sense the consistency there?. Bossen: Yes, basically both. The physicists would come up and say, “Ooh! We can dothis. Can you use it?” And we would be saying, the marketing people, “Look,I can sell a zillion of these if you can measure this.”<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So was there a lot of interaction. Bossen: Yes, and we focused that interaction. We would have quarterly meetings andget the physicists together with the sales people.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you think you were unusual in that. Bossen: I think we probably did it more than most companies, but other companies,I’m sure, were doing that. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: This is certainly a far cry from what you’d experienced at Alcoa, isn’t it. Bossen: Oh yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Where you were burdened by the bureaucracy. Bossen: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It seems to make something like this go, you have to have people fromdifferent perspectives dealing with one another. Bossen: Yes, right. Exactly.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: The old system where you had a department for this and a department for that,which you see, for example, in the pharmaceutical industry, wouldn’t workhere. Bossen: Yes. Well, a lot of companies were organized that way and still are. But theydidn’t get very far in developing successful new applications.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was it an exciting place to work. Bossen: Oh yes! Oh, I enjoyed every day. Getting up, driving down 280 to the officeand thinking about the meetings.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was there a typical day. Bossen: We had all of the normal business functions, like quarterly reports and financereports and manufacturing, and then we had the developmental project reports.I don’t think there was a typical day. There’s a typical month but not a typicalday.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, do a typical month. Bossen: I was afraid I shouldn’t have said that. [laughter] <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I just want to get a flavor of what you, David Bossen, were doing on anygiven month. Bossen: Well, depending on the month, I would review the sales and the sales forecastas they were coming together. I would review every development projectmonthly, at least.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Does that mean you’re looking at documents or you’re interviewing thephysicists. Bossen: Both. And let me tell you where I got most of my information from them—inthe cafeteria. We had a very good cafeteria at Measurex, a nice building andgood food, and people stayed in. I’d wait until lunch hour was about a third ofthe way through, and then I’d walk down and see some guys that I wanted totalk to about projects and go over and sit with them. That was sort of likeHewlett-Packard’s management by walking around. I did management byeating! [chuckling] I did a lot of the management by walking around too. Youlearn so much more that way than you do from the formalized reports.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I suspect that you were not an intimidating boss. In some companies, if theboss sat down at the table, people would quake in their boots. Bossen: I tried not to be because I don’t think that’s how you get the best out ofpeople.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, you’re getting at the company’s culture. Could you say a little bit moreabout that? Was there any conscious intent on your part to encourage thedevelopment of a certain type of culture. Bossen: Yes, there was. I wanted an open culture where people would get around andtalk to each other and work, and I wanted bright, intelligent people. I didn’twant drones. Measurex culture was—I won’t say it was unique, but it wasdarn close to it. I’ve had a lot of people tell me that former employees—andthe rest of it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How would you characterize the culture. Bossen: Open, hard-working, results-oriented. In fact, we characterized ourself as theresults company. Our objective was to get superior economic results for our customers so that they could provide superior economic results for ouremployees and shareholders. That was our statement of objective.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was there any place for basic research. Bossen: Why is the grass green kind of research? No.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, maybe not that basic. Bossen: Well, I don’t know what you mean by basic research then.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, you could say to your team of scientists and technologists thateverything they were doing had to have a definite product in mind. Or youcould say, “Go out and read the literature, find out what’s happening, see ifthere’s anything there that we could take and develop into a product.. Bossen: Yes, we did some of that. But it was mainly product oriented. This issomething we want to do—figure out how to do it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, you more or less said that it would come from both sides. Bossen: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Your scientist would say, “We can do this.” And then you or your sales forceor whomever would say well, “There’s an application.” Or you could belooking at the field out there and say, “There’s a need. Can we fill it?. Bossen: That’s right. And we did it industry by industry and we did it within theindustry. Because once we had achieved a foothold in an industry, like paperfor example, the easiest guy to sell to is the one you just sold to, because hebelieves in you. So if we can find more product for the same plants andmills— Well, the other thing that we did that ties in with the resultsphilosophy, we developed—and this differentiated us from our competitors,particularly the old company in Ohio, who we passed in revenue in four years.From a standing start in the industries we were in, we passed them in fouryears. But the key—well, there were a number of keys—was this resultsorientation. [pause] I’m getting worn down.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you need a break? 3. Bossen: Well, no, not a break. Just how much longer do you see us going here?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] Do you want to end sooner rather than later. Bossen: Well, yes! [laughing]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, we’ll wind up. But I do want to find out, were there a bunch ofcompetitors trying to enter into the same sorts of fields. Bossen: Well, there was the company back in Ohio, and they ultimately got onto thedigital computer. Oh, now I remember what I wanted to emphasize: the keydifference that we built was this results orientation and that we built a biginternational service organization. We made more money selling the servicesthan we did the equipment. Ultimately we had about 3,100, 3,200 employees,of which two thousand were in service around the world, from Finland toTasmania.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you have an office in each country. Bossen: No, they would be based in our customers’ plants basically. When we firstsold a [sensor] system in Jyväskylä, Finland, we hired and trained a Finn ortwo to be there as service representatives, resident in the company. And welost money on that with one [system in place]. As soon as they put in a secondsystem, we broke even. When they’d put in a third system, we made a lot ofmoney on the service. But in order to get that, you had to develop the servicebase, and you did that by putting in people with a system. We took losses inthe beginning, not many because we were profitable all along.Our big competitor back in Ohio went the opposite way. They told thecustomers, “Our systems are so reliable you don’t need any service.” Well,total BS! [chuckling] Any computer-based sensor system is going to requireservice, and we decided that we would do that at the customer’s site. Wewould put a service man at that site. If there were two or three customers in alocal town, he might handle that, but by and large they were devoted. Wemade a lot of money off service ultimately, because we got the servicedensity. See, it feeds on each other. When you put your first guy in the site,he’s losing money. Then you get a second system in, and you break even. Youput a third system in, and you’re making a lot of money. You put in a fourthsystem, you’re making a lot of money. And your customer is happy.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Had you that concept as you initiated this service aspect of the company?. Bossen: I knew that we needed to do that, and I saw that opportunity, and we startedout doing that from day one.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh, really—day one. Bossen: The first three systems that went in—one went in Varkhaus, Finland. No,that’s the next year. Can you slide that report over to me? [reviewing annualreport] This is the 1972 annual report, and it shows the systems. The first threesystems went in—one in Garden State Paper Company in New Jersey, one inFiberboard Corp. which was in Antioch, California then, one in Simpson LeePaper Company out here in Ripon, California. I wanted to get all three of themin California so we could service them easily. And then we started movingout. Our first European systems went into Ahlstrom and Varkhaus, Finland,Bowater in England, and Fundy Forest Industries in Canada. But this [annualreport] shows the first three—1968, ’69, ’70, ’71, ’72. This was a great sellingaid, showing this to our new customers.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It seems pretty adventurous on your part to be starting a company—starting acompany has its problems right there. But then to take on this service conceptright at the start seems compounding the difficulties. Bossen: It makes it much easier. We couldn’t have done it without the servicebusiness. We would have failed had we not had the local service.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because you would have had disgruntled customers. Bossen: Well, here you are, the owner/operator of a very large paper machine. Andyou’re producing product at the rate of a million dollars a week or, on a verybig machine, a million dollars a day. Once you adopt this philosophy of goingdown in the lower half of the tolerance band, you can’t run your machinewithout the system. We guaranteed 99 percent up time, and that’s not enough.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Really. Bossen: Yes. We got up to 99.7.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Which you could only do by having the service market, right. Bossen: Yes. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I know you want to stop, but I want to introduce two more subjects, all right. Bossen: All right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You mentioned the IPO in 1972, and from the little I know it was verysuccessful. Bossen: Yes, it was. The stock came at $20 and it closed at $40 on the same day.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did that astound you. Bossen: It astounded me that it went up that far. I thought it’d probably get to $25 or$30. But the investment bankers priced it for the benefit of their customers,not for our benefit. [chuckling] It should have been priced at $30, but itwasn’t. But that’s okay. We got there.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What was the stock market doing in the early seventies?when we had our IPO. The market had turned and was on the way up.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is that one reason that you held the public offering at that point. Bossen: Yes. If it hadn’t turned, we would have put it off. We could have raised moremoney from our original investors, because they were very happy with theway things were going.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You didn’t worry about the bookkeeping and public presentation and all ofthat that goes along with an IPO. Bossen: We knew we had to do it. It wasn’t a matter of worrying about it. We had todo it, and we had to get ready to do it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But it can make a very different kind of company when you’re beholden toyour public stockholders.. Bossen: I didn’t feel different about it. I felt that we would go back to our originalresults objective: outstanding economic results for our customers so they willgive us outstanding economic results for our employees and shareholders.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So that was your consistent mantra. Bossen: Yes. All the way.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Everybody in the company understood that. Bossen: Yes, we tried to drill that into everybody. This is the results company.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Some of your competitors were not. Bossen: No, they weren’t! Well, most companies are not when you look at them,really. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes. Bossen: They pay lip service to it but—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Then the last topic: the purchase by Honeywell in 1997, right. Bossen: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why was that. Bossen: Well, there were a number of reasons coming along at that point in time, andthey basically had made an offer to us. I felt that the shareholders wouldaccept the offer.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How did you feel about being bought out. Bossen: Well, I felt that we had had a pretty good run. But I wasn’t happy the way itworked out. What had happened was that the CEO at Honeywell, Mike[Michael R.] Bonsignore, was a pretty good guy, and he basically convincedme that he wanted to use Measurex as the model for Honeywell Industrial. And we would be made the point for all of Honeywell. Well, at the same,almost concurrent with our sale to Honeywell, Honeywell was sold to Allied[Signal] back in New Jersey. And Mike went away to become CEO of thecombined companies, and then they basically had Measurex report tosomebody in Phoenix who didn’t know what the hell he was doing.Bonsignore was out of it because he was now running the combined bigAllied, and I couldn’t get any support there. So had I known that would havehappened, I would not have supported the sale. But I didn’t know that, and Ithought it would work out, and it didn’t. Too bad.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were you planning to stay with the company. Bossen: I had agreed to stay with it for three years. But I did not wind up doing what Ithought I would be doing, but I got paid for three more years. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, should we stop there. Bossen: Fine. Thank you. Well, I offered you ladies to come over to the Circus Club,and we’ll have lunch.
