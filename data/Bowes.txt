Interviewer: Well, Mr. Bowes—it’s July 23, 2008, and this is our first interview. I’d like tostart way back with your parents and who they were and what they did andwhat it was like growing up in their family.Bowes: Well, my mother came from an orange ranch in southern California. She gotto Stanford and then she went on to Stanford Medical School. My father camefrom Chicago, and when he came through here in the army, he liked what hesaw and came back from Chicago and after the army went to Stanford. Hegraduated, came to San Francisco, never left. So I was born here, one brother,grew up, went to public schools, and then I went to Stanford.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you ever consider going anywhere else?Bowes: I didn’t apply anywhere else. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Those were the days! [chuckling]Bowes: My high school, Lowell High School, even though it was a public school,seemed to have a pipeline into Stanford, so that if you went to Lowell youwent to Stanford.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You went to Stanford. That was all there was to it.Bowes: Of course Stanford was, in spite of being a private school, extremelyreasonable in those days, unlike now. After a year at Stanford I got draftedand went down to the South Pacific in the army infantry and then went to thePhilippines and then Occupied Japan and came back and resumed, in duecourse, Stanford.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did that military and wartime experience change any way you looked at theworld?Bowes: Oh it had to, it had to broaden you out, made you realize that it’s a big world.Occupied Japan was interesting too, living amongst a completely differentculture. It was very, very interesting. But I always had jobs, summer jobs andsuch, that were broadening in a knowing the world sense. I was a counselor ata YMCA boys’ camp in the Sierras. Most of the kids had never been out of the city, so that kind of broadens you out. I had a job up in construction inAlaska, and I had a job up in the forest industry in Mendocino County. I madea point of getting out and around—out of my comfort zone. So after I gotthrough Stanford I decided to go to business school, and went back toHarvard.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And why business school?Bowes: Well, I thought about being a doctor, but I didn’t make it through frog cutting.[laughter] I decided business school would give me a way of looking atwhether I wanted to be in business or not. I decided I liked business.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes. Was that anything to do with your father’s profession? In terms of theinfluence.Bowes: Yes, probably. He’d been in finance. He worked for a Chicago firm. He rantheir San Francisco office—he and his twin brother together. He stayed inbusiness all of his professional life. So I didn’t want to do what he did, but Ithought something related to business would be fine.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And what was his business?Bowes: It changed a lot over the course of time [chuckling]. First he was in theinvestment banking business, and then during the Depression he foundinvestments for some Texas oil people who had money. He found them realestate investments in California. Then he got into the hotel business and endedup owning, with his brother and some others, several hotels here, which heeventually sold and retired.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Could you describe him as an entrepreneur?Bowes: Yes. He didn’t have much choice, without a job—you’re an entrepreneur! Hedid lots of different things just to get by, really. But that all ended well. Theywere always very gentle, kind people. My mother having gone to medicalschool, they had lots of medical friends, and I think it was a very nice familyenvironment for me and my brother.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It was unusual in that era—aren’t we’re talking about, what, the thirtiesmaybe? Bowes: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: For a woman to go to medical school.Bowes: She went in the twenties.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, really?Bowes: She was—there were two women in the class and they became very goodfriends. [laughter] She graduated in 1925, got married within three or fourmonths. They decided not to get married until after she’d passed her stateexams, which she did and they got married. And the rest is family history.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes. Was there a lot of discussion around the dinner table, or wherever, ofmedical subjects?Bowes: No, except that she forced me to eat things I didn’t want to eat like cod liveroil and carrot juice, and all that nasty stuff. But I knew it was for my owngood, at least that’s what she told me. No, she didn’t talk about medical stuffmuch, because her day was in two pieces—you know, work and play. So wehad conversations about everything in the world but not much medical.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And is your brother younger or older?Bowes: He died two-and-a-half years ago, but he was younger. Two years younger. Sothat was unfortunate, very sudden.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So Harvard Business School—and why Harvard?Bowes: I wanted to get East Coast experience. I’d never been to the East Coast exceptonce to go to the New York World’s Fair. I thought I should get away fromthe West for a while, and Harvard seemed like the best of the best. If you werea returning service person like I was, it was easier to get into Harvard than itwould have been otherwise.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was it, yes. Bowes: Harvard Business School usually requires you to have two, three, four years ofwork experience before you go there, so I was not coming straight out ofcollege, so they figured the army was equivalent to work experience.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, was it?Bowes: Oh yes. When the war ended I was training to invade Japan. That would havebeen fun.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Where were you stationed in Japan?Bowes: I was between Yokohama and Tokyo. The higher ups were afraid that thesoldiers would go native or misbehave or something, so they made us stayinside these zones, and you couldn’t go outside your zone. So in spite of beingin Japan for well over a year, I didn’t see much of Japan except for my zone.Luckily it was Tokyo/Yokohama and about fifteen miles wide on each side, sothere was something, but it was—I missed the mountains of Japan. I missed alot.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, but if I’m remembering correctly, you were in longer than the war itself.Was that—Bowes: Oh sure, Occupied Japan you were in longer than the War.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see, so you stayed during the occupation.Bowes: Yes. The war ended in September or something and I went up to Japan inOctober, and I was there for a year.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see. So it wasn’t during the war, it was just in the occupation.Bowes: If it was during the war, I’d be dead. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] We don’t want that.Bowes: We were trained to invade Japan. The bombs dropped, the emperor declaredthe war to be over, the Americans had won, and so the Japanese people said, “Okay, the war is over. The Americans have won.” And the emperor said,“You now have a new emperor. His name is [Douglas] MacArthur.”<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, right, and he loved that [being treated as an emperor]! [chuckling]Bowes: Oh did he love that. I went up to Tokyo three times to see a spectacle whichwas every six days General MacArthur would leave his office at 5:25 and he’dgo home. And 3:30, 4:30, 5:00, Japanese would start to gather in the streetoutside of his office. So at 5:25 the door would open to the office and he’dmarch out with that magisterial stride he had and—he didn’t return salutes. Hehad a major general to do that. He’d stride into the car, this door would slamshut, and off he’d go. And four thousand Japanese would go—[a sound ofsharp intake of breath]. It made their day. Nine seconds of MacArthur hadmade their day.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] He could really play the part, couldn’t he.Bowes: But he had feet of clay too.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did he—in what are you thinking of?Bowes: Well, if you read David Halberstam’s book about the Korean War, you lose alot of respect for MacArthur, in how he ran that war. It was just disgraceful.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I haven’t read the book.Bowes: It’s about that long [indicating a very thick book?]—it’s called The ColdestWar, The Coldest Winter, or something. [The Coldest Winter: America andthe Korean War] It’s a very good book. He was very thorough. ButMacArthur was perfect for Japan. He just took right up where the emperor hadleft off and caused a terrific constitution to be written. It’s still theirconstitution today.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was it his personality to be regal and imperial?Bowes: I think it suited his personality. He had a huge ego. There’s another book onMacArthur called The Imperial something or other. And that’s a gooddescription—imperial. He walked like a king of the earth. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I diverted you from Harvard Business School, which was probably anentirely different kettle of fish. What did you learn there? Were there anymemorable teachers or memorable moments of any kind?Bowes: Well, I had a lot of fun there and made a lot of friends. I think the mostmemorable teacher was one of the original venture capitalists named General[Georges] Doriot. You’ve probably heard his name before.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, I have.Bowes: He was kind of like MacArthur in a way. All of the other classes at Harvard—they used the case method there. You read the case the night before and thenthe teacher calls on various students to discuss the case and what you woulddo in the situation. It’s very interactive. Doriot didn’t do any of that. He justgot up there, on a stage, if you will, and talked at us. He would discuss anyone of a number of things. It seemed random—it probably wasn’t. He wouldsay things like, “One thing you must do with your life is to read the New YorkTimes obituary column every day, to see what people have done with theirlives. They might be an example for you.” It was good stuff, but it wasn’twhat Harvard Business School was—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why is he so renowned, so remembered?Bowes: Well, he had quite a career. He was a general in the army, in our army. Hewas a Frenchman who’d come to this country and succeeded, and he was,some say, the first venture capitalist.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you agree with that label?Bowes: He was certainly one of the first. He might have been the first to start a formalventure capital firm as opposed to somebody like a Rockefeller who would doventure capital investing for his own account. He might have been the first totake outside money and go about it in that way, which set a model for all ofus.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Had he done that all when you appeared on the scene? I forget the dates.Bowes: I think he had. At least he was getting it started. I forget his career dates. Inever paid that much attention. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: The company—American Research—Bowes: And Development.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Development—was that around when you were in school?Bowes: That’s what I can’t remember. I suspect so, I suspect so.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, that’s easy to find out. [note: founded in 1946]Bowes: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did any of this resonate years later? Was there anything there that might haveguided you in what was to come?Bowes: Nothing direct. It all became useful background, I guess, but I didn’t take anyparticular lesson and apply it later. I just got sort of a general—Harvard’stheme is to create an important business person. They don’t try to make you agreat accountant or a great marketier. They want you to be a successfulbusinessman and a good person and a credit to the profession, and so forth.Specific lessons, I didn’t carry much of those. I just came out feeling goodabout myself and ready to ramble. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So you were hooked. Or had you been hooked already? Were you pretty surewhen you entered that business was going to be the career?Bowes: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes.Bowes: I couldn’t think of anything else. [chuckling] I mean—it wasn’t going to bescience or medicine.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, you’d eliminated medicine, right. I’m thinking of the connections ofwhich there seem to be so many in what then became the pioneering group ofventure capitalists on the West Coast. Were there any connections made atHarvard that then you would play upon—or maybe that’s not the nicest terminology. Were there personal associations that you then continued in yourfuture career?Bowes: Really just one, with Pitch [Franklin] Johnson. We were classmates.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were you. I’d forgotten that.Bowes: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And you became friends at that stage?Bowes: Absolutely. We became pals and we’ve had some interaction the rest of ourlives, including co-investing.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Really, which you talked about at that stage?Bowes: No, no, no. I didn’t have any idea what I was going to do and neither did he.He took a job with Inland Steel Company, which had nothing to do withventure capital or anything else. He just got that job. His father had workedfor a steel company.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: His father-in-law.Bowes: No, his father.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was it?Bowes: His father-in-law was an oilman.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh, that’s right.Bowes: His father worked for Kaiser Steel, and I guess he’d grown up a bit in thatmilieu, so he went to work for a steel company for a while and he lived inIndiana. Bill Draper worked for the same company.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That’s right. Bowes: But I went straight back out to California.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Had you always planned to return to the West Coast?Bowes: Yes. If somebody had offered me a fab job in Boston or New York, out of theblue, I might have thought about that, but nobody did. So I just drove west. I took about eight months off after I graduated. I had a year at Stanford, threeyears in the service, three years at Stanford, two years at Harvard. I just felt Ineeded a break, and so I took a break. I didn’t even look for a job for sixmonths. It drove my parents crazy! [laughter] I hung in there. I lived at homeand learned how to play golf and did some traveling up and down the coastand just fiddled. I went looking for a job on the first of the year in ’53. So Ifound a job.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were you thinking about the next step during that period? Or was it allserendipity?Bowes: It was serendipitous. I was looking for a job and I got offered jobs that Idecided I didn’t want. Then I got offered a job I did want, and they retractedthe offer—and then they retracted the retraction.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And why? Why were you having second thoughts?Bowes: Oh I wasn’t having second thoughts. They offered me the job, and then theson of an important client of the firm said he wanted the job, so they decidedto give it to him because my father was not an important client. Then theydecided that was a bad idea. After he had a month on the job he decided hewould rather work with his father. So they got back, offered it to me and Isaid, “Sure.”<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And is that Blyth Eastman?Bowes: Blyth and Company.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What’s the relationship between Blyth and Company and Blyth Eastman?Bowes: That was a merger about twenty years later. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh I see.Bowes: They were two separate firms. Eastman Dillon was pretty much a New Yorkfirm, and Blyth was a New York-San Francisco firm. It started in SanFrancisco. It was a great place. It was a small, high-quality investmentbanking firm which had terrific clients. We certainly worked with great peopleand great personnel. It was a fantastic place to work. I couldn’t have enjoyedit more, for at least the first twenty years, and then times changed. I was doing fine. I was vice president and director and all that stuff, but thefounders of the firm, the big guys in the firm decided the time had come tocash in—retire and cash in. So they found a big insurance company thatwanted to buy Blyth and they sold it. It wasn’t as much fun after that. Theinsurance company decided they didn’t like the business after all, so they soldus again and then we were sold again the third time. That’s when I left.Twenty-five years.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Wow. Tell me what you were doing during that period. I know it has to be anoutline, but it must be somehow related to what came next.Bowes: Well, it was finance. It was finance and financing. It was in mergers andinitial public offerings and consulting to your clients and what their strategieswould be, should be. We had clients like the Bank of America and Chevron,PG&E, Hewlett-Packard. We were a premier investment banking firm up anddown the coast. Just as a part of looking for business for the firm, I wasspending quite a bit of time in Silicon Valley, starting in about 1955 or so.Pretty early, and I took Hewlett-Packard public in the late fifties.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you.Bowes: That was the best firm down there. A real look up to firm. I got to know quitea few people that were in the companies {words unclear}, and I got to knowsome venture capitalists and poked around and got to know people. This wasprobably starting in about ’55 and been going on for a good twenty years. Ihad a lot of close, but not intimate relationships with a lot of people down inSilicon Valley. It seemed like it was going to be an interesting—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: In the companies.Bowes: In the companies, yes. Then a friend of mine, actually a classmate of minefrom Harvard, got a job with a startup company, and he suggested it wasgoing to be a good company, so I invested in it. Not much. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: This was a Silicon Valley startup?Bowes: Yes, called Raychem. I went on the board of that company, and so that gaveme more reason to be down in the valley. I made friends with Bill Draper andother people. I could see the beginnings of something happening down here.Before venture capital was institutionalized down there, there were someindividual practitioners who happened to be friends of mine. They wereolder—one of them was named Ed Heller. He would make individualinvestments, and one was named Joe McMicking and he would makeindividual investments. These were their own funds. Ed Heller—he was afunny guy. He refused to make an investment decision until the afternoon,because he thought he had better judgment after a couple of drinks at lunch.[laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: He may have been right!Bowes: He may have been right. We’ll never know. But he made some good bets.Don’t ask me the year, but along in there somewhere, Bill Draper’s father anda couple of his buddies formed a venture capital firm called Draper, Gaither &Anderson. They had zero experience in venture capital, zero experience withsmall companies.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I958-1959 I think it was.Bowes: Was that when it was?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes.Bowes: I think it was in there somewhere. Bill Draper’s father was kind of a classicmilitary-industrial complex kind of a guy. In and out of the halls of power.Gaither was—he had been president of the Ford Foundation, and Andersonwas a retired air force general. Not a likely group, but they started a firm and Igot friendly with those guys and so they, every six months, or every threemonths they asked me to come down and evaluate their portfolio, so I did that.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] Now was your “in” your friendship with young Bill Draper?Bowes: No.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Or just because you were in the technology investment sector. Bowes: Yes, yes. Bill Draper went to work there a bit later.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Right, yes.Bowes: That firm did terribly.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did it?Bowes: Because I had to report them on their performance. They didn’t know whatthey were doing.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did they call themselves venture capitalists?Bowes: Sure, it sounded good. [<|endoftext|>
Interviewer laughs] So Bill Draper left and went intobusiness with Pitch—Draper and Johnson—and they got along fine, except ina business way and decided to split, still buddies.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because they saw business from a different perspective? Or why?Bowes: No. They’re both terrific venture capitalists, but Bill Draper is very intuitiveand Pitch is very fact oriented. Draper was too impatient to wait for Pitch, andPitch couldn’t stand these early decisions that Draper wanted to make,because the facts weren’t in yet. So they just couldn’t get along professionallybut stayed buddies.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were you aware of this at the time? Or is this all after the fact?Bowes: Oh yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now were you beginning to perk up your ears about this thing called venturecapital?Bowes: No. I was too happy with what I was doing. So Bill Draper founded SutterHill and Pitch did Asset Management and they both did fine. Another firmthat started up along about that same time, maybe a little later, was Davis &Rock. Tommy [Thomas J.] Davis, [Jr.] and Arthur Rock. Arthur Rock wasahead of me in business school. I didn’t know him, but— <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you know Tommy Davis?Bowes: Yes, I did. They had a great success and then they, for some reason not knownto me, they split. In my investment banking capacity, I raised some money forTommy Davis to start a new fund called Mayfield. Which is now still with us.It’s got a long history of success. I worked for six months to raise that moneyfor Tommy and came up with $3.5 million which seemed like a lot, but inthese days, that’s one investment, so times have changed.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Where and how were you raising this money? Because this was early on.Bowes: I was calling on Stanford and calling on Berkeley and calling on institutionswith money and trying to get them to write a little check.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And were they receptive?Bowes: It was hard. It was hard. It was pretty early. Tommy was a hell of a nice guy,but he didn’t come across as being an aggressive money maker the wayArthur Rock did, so it was a bit of a problem, but we did it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How did you come across?Bowes: How did I come across?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes.Bowes: Well, I don’t know—probably not as forceful as I could have been, because Ididn’t know if he was going to make it or not. I liked Tommy a lot. Anyway,we got the money together and went into business and they’re probably onfund twelve or something, now, but half a million dollars at a crack, so—butyou’ve got to start somewhere. [sound of cannons firing in background]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is that part of the regatta [on San Francisco Bay]?Bowes: Yes. They’ve been shooting cannons off.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You said you liked what you were doing. What was it that grabbed youparticularly? Bowes: Oh just—investment banking was kind of a consulting job. You’re consultingwith companies about their financial strategy, you’re helping them raisemoney and which is the best way to raise the money. You’re helping them ifthey see a company they want to buy, helping them get that done. If they wantto sell themselves you help them get that done. It’s a very interesting kind ofbusiness with all kinds of life experiences, and it was—in those days thereweren’t that many people doing it, so you felt kind of like a little exclusiveclub. It was a great firm, so we had opportunities to consult with all kinds ofcorporate people up and down the coast. Sold the Folger[s] company toProcter & Gamble—Folger[s] Coffee. We did the first Ford Motor Companypublic offering. All kinds of stuff. But after the sale of the company andanother sale of the company, another sale of the company, it got to be a lotless fun, so I quit. I just quit in ‘78.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes. But before that happened, while you were still having fun, how much areyou flying by the seat of your pants and how much of it is based on what youhad learned? Well, first—and I didn’t ask questions about this—I know your undergraduatedegree is in economics and then, of course, we’ve talked about the HarvardBusiness School. How well is that preparing you for what’s to come, and howmuch of it do you just have to pick up as you’re going along?Bowes: I think you have to pick up 99 percent as you go along. I started out atStanford in chemical engineering. When I got back to Stanford after threeyears in the service, my brain was mush. I could no more do chemicalengineering than fly to the moon, so I switched to economics. [laughter] Easy.I deserved some fun at Stanford after three years in the infantry.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And was the major practically oriented?Bowes: No, completely not.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It was very theoretical?Bowes: Very theoretical, and bad theories.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [laughing] Bad theories. So you left all that behind. Bowes: Oh boy. Essentially I took the minimum required courses in economics to getby, sort of a gentleman’s B-minus, and did everything else that was availableat Stanford—all the electives that you could possibly do. That’s where the joyof Stanford came into play.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, yes. Good strategy.Bowes: At Harvard, the courses were pretty well laid out for you. You didn’t have alot of—the first year you had absolutely no choice. You took every coursethey prescribed for you. The second, of course you had a little choice, but nota whole lot. So you couldn’t really focus on something except take the wholecourse and be a generally better-prepared person when you left than when youarrived, but nothing specific, nothing specific. We had guys—there were no women then—we had guys—there are now—wehad guys go to work for Macy’s because they wanted to do retail. We hadguys go to work for Procter & Gamble; they wanted to do consumer goods.We had guys go to work for McKinsey; they wanted to do consulting. We hadguys go to Wall Street; we had guys go back to their family company.Everybody was supposed to be better prepared for this by virtue of those twoyears than they would have been otherwise, and I’m sure we were. Nothingspecific. They kind of pride themselves on that—Harvard.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And still do?Bowes: Still do. Problem solving is their mantra.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: A pretty good one, don’t you think? [a siren in the background] All right.Bowes: Next year is their hundredth anniversary.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is that so?Bowes: Oh—this year, this year.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Are you going to celebrate?Bowes: I’m going to go back. I’m on the visiting committee there. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh are you? What does that mean?Bowes: That’s a committee that goes back there once a year and gets up to date onwhat’s happening at the school. We comment back to them what we thinkthey’re missing and what we think they’re doing well, sort of interactive.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Does anybody listen to you?Bowes: Well, we write a report and they’re supposed to read it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] All right. So with all these acquisitions you—the climate ischanging in your world of investment banking, right? And this must be 1978,because that’s when you leave. So what do you think you’re going to do whenyou leave twenty-five years of investment banking?Bowes: I thought I would do some venture capital.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, well, you know there’s something that comes before this that I wouldlike you to talk about actually, and that’s Cetus, because my notes say that youjoin the board of Cetus in 1972 and you left in 1978, so you were leaving a lotof things in 1978.Bowes: Yes, well, I guess I was on the Raychem board. I was on the Cetus board.They asked me to come on the board, and I thought biotechnology was reallyinteresting. The reason I left Cetus was that I came to believe that they wereapproaching biotech the wrong way. I thought they didn’t have enoughemphasis on the science and too much on the promotion.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you attribute that largely to the two people at the head of Cetus?Bowes: Sure, sure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you say so? I mean, you were on the board.Bowes: Yes, I said so and it didn’t take—so there. It was a five-year process.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [laughter] I have a feeling that you’re condensing quite a bit of information.Well, I know because I talked to him— Bowes: Who?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Moshe Alafi was associated with Cetus early on. In fact, even earlier thanyou—no maybe not.Bowes: He was a founder.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, he was a founder. So how did you get there? Had you known Moshe?Bowes: Moshe and one of my many bosses were friends. Moshe, I think, asked forhelp in getting an outside director to come on over, and so my boss said,“Why don’t you do that?”<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And was that just pro forma? Or was it because Moshe thought that there weresome problems?Bowes: I don’t know if he thought there were problems at that time, but he thoughthe’d just like another head around the table. He might have felt uneasy abouthis partners. He should have. But they asked a big-time scientist fromBerkeley on the board, and this is what I mean—a big time scientist fromBerkeley—no biology background. Pure physics. So what’s he going to do?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, that’s Don [Donald A.] Glaser, right?Bowes: Nice guy, but he didn’t belong on a biotech board. He was just windowdressing.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, well—except that he had that scanner of his which Cetus put a lot ofattention on in those early days.Bowes: That was one of the things I didn’t—nothing to do with therapies.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, was that indeed what Cetus, at that point, had set out to do? To become,essentially, a pharmaceutical company?Bowes: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: In those early days? Bowes: Yes, that’s what all the startup biotechs had decided they wanted to be. Theywanted to be biopharmaceutical companies. They wanted to make drugs andcure people with a brand new technology.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, you know, it’s really kind of an amazing story, because Stan [StanleyN.] Cohen was on the scientific board early on—he becomes a consultant in1975. It seems to me that Cetus, above any other firm—and there weren’t anyothers at that point doing what we now call biotech—had a golden opportunityto leap early into the commercialization of recombinant DNA.Bowes: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was that anything that interested you? And do you remember anydiscussions?Bowes: Oh it interested me a lot, and I didn’t think they were going about doing thatin the right way. That’s why I left.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, say a little more about that. What were they doing wrong?Bowes: Well, I think if you’re going to get into a brand new technology or a brandnew science, whatever you want to call it, you’ve got to engage with superscientists. I don’t mean on your board, I mean working in the company. Imean that’s what you do. You get super scientists to work with and they dothe necessary—and just saying we’re going to be a biopharmaceuticalcompany, aren’t we wonderful, doesn’t really cut it. Cetus, to their credit, theystayed alive, they raised a lot of money. They bought a couple of interestingproperties, and then they got taken over by whoever they got taken over by.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Chiron.Bowes: Chiron. That’s right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But that was later. That was 1991, I think, or ’90 if I remember.Bowes: They had one genius scientist at Cetus who developed the PCR [polymerasechain reaction] technology and that’s really what Chiron wanted. There wasnothing therapeutic coming out of Cetus. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And was that what you were pushing? You were trying to direct them towardstherapeutics?Bowes: Oh you know, those were early days, and you were hoping that therapeuticswould evolve out of all this. My problem was they didn’t have enoughemphasis on hiring excellent scientists to do interesting work. They were justdoing everything else but that. And so I just—I kind of threw up my hands.I’d been critical of the management. They were glad I left. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I don’t think you were the only one that was critical, either.Bowes: They had forced Moshe out long before that.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, yes. Did you have interactions with Stan Cohen? Who after all was, withHerb Boyer, Mr. Recombinant DNA.Bowes: I had interactions with Stan Cohen later, but not during that time.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Not during that period, yes. All right. Was it Cetus that sparked your interestin biotechnology?Bowes: [pause before answering] It was a combination of Cetus and Genentech.Genentech was doing it right and Cetus was doing it wrong.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes. And you were quite aware of that at the time? I mean, now we knowthat’s true.Bowes: Well, within six months of Genentech being founded, I figured they weredoing it the right way.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How did you know?Bowes: I knew the names of the scientists they’d hired. They had great resumes. Theyweren’t spending money on peripheral stuff. It was all science.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, well, and also, Swanson was very focused.Bowes: Yes. On that. 20<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes—now does that—Bowes: Herb Boyer worked in the company. He wasn’t just an advisor. He had hissleeves rolled up.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you know him at that point?Bowes: Oh I was acquainted. I didn’t know him.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, yes. And I know we’re jumping ahead, because I’m thinking ofAmgen—which doesn’t come along until 1981? Or was it 1980—1980 Iguess.Bowes: Seventy-nine.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Really, when you began to talk about it. But before we get quite there, I’mwondering if Genentech is a model that you have in mind when you dobecome associated with Amgen.Bowes: [pause] Not consciously. Not consciously, because these small biotechcompanies are extremely secretive about what they’re doing, and you don’tknow much unless you’re on the inside, and I wasn’t—just as a friendlyacquaintance. So I suspected they were doing things right, but I didn’t knowfor a fact. I didn’t know enough about what they were doing to copy them. Ijust knew they were hiring terrific, terrific people.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, well, another thing you must have known too, because it was so wellpublicized, was their spectacular IPO. Isn’t that some indication that they’redoing things right?Bowes: Sure. When was that?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: 1980.Bowes: 1980. Yes, that was encouraging, because I’d actually started to work onAmgen in ’79. Just conceptually, so it was nice to have a kind of a publicvalidation of science being important in the public market. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Had your ears perked up by then? Were you following—maybe it was only inthe newspapers. But this budding industry, this application of basic biologicalscience in these cases with the idea—well, not always, but often, to maketherapeutics, to make drugs.Bowes: Yes, well, sure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So that was in your consciousness, along with everything else.Bowes: Oh sure—we had Biogen in Boston and lots of little sprouts. There were quitea few budding biotech companies. A lot of them didn’t make it. There was lotsof activity going on in San Diego and the Bay Area and Boston, for sure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Biogen was another one with an interesting business model in those earlydays, with people scattered all over Europe.Bowes: Yes, they were in Switzerland. That’s right, they had two headquarters.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, they also had key scientists in Scotland and there was [Walter H.]Gilbert at Harvard.Bowes: Gilbert was more important though than the Scottish guys. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So this was becoming an interest, in other words.Bowes: Oh sure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Before Amgen had really gotten off the ground?Bowes: Oh sure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes—well, I think we’re there. We’re at Amgen, and you said 1979 you beginto talk about it. So tell me that story, please.Bowes: [pause] Well, the story, I guess, is fairly simple. The story is that there were alot of superb scientists who were not associated with any biotech company, soI thought there was room for another good one down south, as opposed to theBay Area. So I went to—I thought the first step would be to put together a scientific advisory board, who could point [us in] promising directions, andit’d also be a help in attracting good management to the company. So I wentdown to Stanford and talked to a guy named, a biology professor named[Robert T.] Bob Schimke. He said he thought that it was a great idea, but hewas going to stay fully academic.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That’s interesting, because as you probably were quite aware, it was notexactly the done thing that professors, biology professors, form companies atthat time.Bowes: Well, that’s right. What I was asking Bob to do was not to form a company,but to put together an all star set of scientific advisors for a company. Hedidn’t want to do that, but he pointed me to a guy down at UCLA who he saidwould do that.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why do you think he didn’t want to do it?Bowes: He was immersed in some recently interesting scientific project in his lab. Hedidn’t want to be diverted. Anyway—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I don’t know much about him, but the one thing that seems to berelevant to what we’re talking about is the fact that he had a way ofmultiplying genes—I’m putting it probably not at all in scientific terms—butthe end result was that more protein could be expressed. Was that what he wasonto at that point? Because that, of course, becomes important when you’retrying to commercialize the science.Bowes: Well, there were a lot of scientists who were kind of in that game. All I’mtelling you is he didn’t want to be involved in anything commercial at thatmoment in time. He later came on the Amgen scientific advisory board, butthat was maybe two years later. So he sent me to a guy down in UCLA namedWinston Salser, who wanted to do this. He went to work and rounded up ascientific advisory board. We would meet, and people would fly in or drive inand we’d meet. This went on fall of ’79 on into the spring of ’80, and we got itput together. Along the way there, I’d enlisted Pitch to be my partner in theenterprise and—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now was that the first time the two of you had actually done businesstogether? Bowes: [pause] I forget, but it was fairly early. There had been three or four situationsand I don’t remember the precise timing. So we decided to put the company inThousand Oaks, California.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why there?Bowes: There were three reasons actually. One was that it was equidistant from ourmain scientific advisors—UCLA, Caltech, and UC Santa Barbara, which wasequally painful for all of them. It was right there in the middle. The secondone was that the living was very cheap—perfect for young scientists, postdocs, and also, there was very nice living in Santa Barbara, Ventura—seniorexecutives could enjoy, so a nice combination. The third was it was in thenon-smog belt. The fog came in at night there, from the sea, and that’simportant to young scientists. They don’t want to work in L.A. They don’twant to work in Athens. They want to work in San Francisco or ThousandOaks. And then we set about to find a chief executive, which took a while, butwe found George [Rathmann] and—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So Salser was never going to be a CEO?Bowes: He wanted to be, but we disabused him of that notion. Then he wanted to bechief scientist and he wanted to be head of research and we disabused him ofthat. We’d come to realize that as energetic as he is and as well spoken as heis, he’s not a scientist who was greatly respected by the other scientists, sothere was no way you could be a leader of a group of scientists. So he had tobe told the facts of life and he went back to his lab with some stock.[chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Are you adept at doing that sort of thing?Bowes: I’m not crazy about it, but I can do it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, you’ve had to do it, haven’t you?Bowes: Oh yes. That’s the venture capital business, and people that had a nice run butthe job has now gone on to be too big for them—.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Let’s stop there. Julie needs to change the tape.[End Audio File 1] <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Where does Sam [Samuel J.] Wohlstadter fit into this story?Bowes: Sam and I teamed up to call on Bob Schimke at Stanford. He thought it was agood idea to start a biotech company too—a fairly promotional guy, and Isaid, “Okay, let’s do it together.”<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Had you known him?Bowes: Oh for about a year, I guess. I’d say that Sam was not helpful during theprocess of putting the whole thing together, in that he was extremelypromotional and extremely [pause] greedy. [laughter] He wasn’t the rightperson to try to get some scientists to work together and do things. He just wasvery bombastic, so we just had to disassociate fairly early in the process. Hedidn’t like that, but—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did Pitch then come into the picture because of that?Bowes: No, no. Pitch was already in the picture.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Pitch was in it. I see.Bowes: We had to team up on Sam.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It sounds to me as though you’re pretty much—you not only had the conceptfor this company—but is it fair to say at this early stage that you’re prettymuch running the show?Bowes: My title was chairman and treasurer [chuckling].<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Okay. That’s a pretty good combination!Bowes: That’s what they do in New England. I’d say by that time Pitch and I weredoing it together. We were partners.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And you two did see eye to eye most of the time on how things should be? Bowes: Yes. We teamed up on recruiting the chief executive officer that we needed.In fact, we did our final sales pitch to George in Pitch’s back yard in PaloAlto, on a beautiful July evening. Come on out from Chicago and here we arein California.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Not bad, eh? Right. Now you had contrasted Bill Draper and Pitch in thebasics of how they go about venture capital, because you just said that youand Pitch see things more or less in the same light. Does that mean that youtoo have a more fact-based way of going about venture capital than intuitive?Bowes: I suppose. I’m pretty intuitive about people, but I like more than just a smile. Isee something that hangs together, so Pitch and I get along fine in that sense.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Say some more about George Rathmann.Bowes: Well, George had had a big job at 3M Minneapolis and then he’d gone toAbbott Laboratories in Chicago. He was tapped—he was a chemist—and hehad become head of research and development for the diagnostic part ofAbbott and he had gotten interested in biotechnology. The reason we’d foundhim was that he had taken a six-month leave of absence from Abbott to go outto UCLA and piddle around in the labs there. Winston Salser had noticed himand thought he was a likely prospect. So then when Winston suggested him,even though we didn’t give it much credit because it came from Winston,[laughter] when we met George we were sold. We started to work on Georgein spring of ’80 and sold him in July, and he went to work in AugustSeptember and the rest is history. He’s probably the best startup CEO I’veever met.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Really, really.Bowes: He started with nothing. Scientific advisory board living other places over atother jobs. He’s got his scientific advisors to advise him, but he built thecompany from scratch. It’s not that easy. To hire people, to convince people tocome—employees number two, three, and four—that’s kind of lonely. ButGeorge is—we called him “The Golden Throat.” He could talk anybody intoanything.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, but it was more than talk.Bowes: Oh yes. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How would you describe his abilities as a CEO? What was there there thatmade him almost an idolized manager—or I don’t know why I say almost, heis an idolized CEO.Bowes: He was very smart. He was tireless. He was extremely persuasive in the rightway, and he would reason with you until you understood. He didn’t bowl youover, he just sat down—“Let’s talk about this. It doesn’t matter how long ittakes. We’ll do it until we’re on the same page.” His people would just walkthrough walls for him. You’ve never seen more loyalty to a man. And he was good at raising money. Biotech companies eat a lot of moneybefore they get anywhere and he was good at getting money from corporatepartners. He was good at persuading investors to write checks. So he was theall-around guy. He had no weakness. The only weakness he had was he didn’twant to be part of a big company. So when Amgen got to be big, he didn’twant to be there anymore. Too much unimportant stuff. Meetings—less oneon-ones and more meetings, et cetera, et cetera.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you try to persuade him out of leaving?Bowes: No. He wasn’t going to be persuaded. He made up his mind; he announced itto the board and that was it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did that worry you? He was so much Amgen.Bowes: Oh sure. We didn’t like that at all! [chuckling] But we found the next guy andit worked out fine.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: He—I’m trying to think of those. The very early CEOs—and isn’t he the onlyone that had the scientific background but also had some business andadministrative experience? I mean, Genentech had that in two people, but I’mtrying to think of another early figure in biotech that had both thosebackgrounds.Bowes: Well, I don’t know that—probably not. You’re probably right. I don’t knowfor sure. I wasn’t on the team with some of the other biotechs. I wasn’tfollowing Biogen and how they were managed.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That was a bunch of scientists in the beginning. Bowes: I’m sure it was.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You have a building named after you at Amgen.Bowes: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How do you feel about that?Bowes: It feels great.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was that a surprise? Or did you know it was coming.Bowes: It was a surprise. I have a statue, too.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: A statue, too. Are you running like Pitch?Bowes: No, I’m contemplating my navel or something. [laughter] I can show you alittle copy of it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, I’d like to see it.Bowes: We can put it right there! [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, you know, what’s happening around this time is you’re doing—you’renot just sitting on your laurels thinking and doing Amgen, you’re alsofounding USVP, U.S. Venture Partners. [brief pause in recording] All right.USVP, which was founded, as you know, in 1981.Bowes: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why did that come about? How did that come about?Bowes: Well, in ’78 I decided I wanted to go into venture capital, and I was doing itan unusual way. I was finding situations that I thought were worth doing, likeAmgen, and I was rounding up the money from various sources—venturecapitalists and so forth. I was doing it out of an office here in the Bank ofAmerica building, and it was interesting and fun, but it was a bit far from Silicon Valley and it was a bit lonely. I was all by myself. So I thought aboutstarting a firm and luckily found two other guys who also wanted to go intoventure capital. So we decided to form up a partnership and do it, and wedecided that in, probably 1981 early. We drew up the papers and got intobusiness in say, June or July of ’81 and started looking for money.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes. Who were the other two?Bowes: One was a guy named Stuart [G.] Moldaw, who just died, who was a retailguru. That was going to be one of our arms, and then Bob [Robert] Sackmanwas the technology guru. He’d been number two at Ampex, and he’s sincedied also. So we were—it was 1980, we were all in our fifties, sort of a secondcareer for all of us. So we found some cheap space in Menlo Park and startedlooking for money and found some money and got into real business early in1982. It took us about eight months to round up the money—went all over thecountry looking for money [chuckling].<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes. So were you all reeling in your previous connections? Or making newones.Bowes: Making new ones.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Really. Give me an example of how you went about that.Bowes: Well, we essentially said we were all very experienced people. I mean, StuMoldaw had documented success in the retail business and Bob Sackman’sbeen a technology leader in Silicon Valley and I’ve put together two or threecompanies already just all by myself, so I guess I know what I’m doing. Wemake a good team, so why don’t you believe in us and write us a check? Thatwas hard work. We finally got a couple—we got two breaks. We got GeneralElectric pension fund to take a chance with us and we got Allstate to take achance with us. That made it a lot easier.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now had they done investments of that type before? High-risk investments?Bowes: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: They had. Bowes: Yes, in fact Allstate had its own department for doing that. They decided theymight like to see how their department compared to somebody else that wason the ground in Silicon Valley and not working out of Chicago. I think theydid it to compare us to their own show, and about four years later they closedup their own operation. [chuckling] So we got in business, and last month wedid our tenth fund, in June of this year, so it’s been pretty steady. We’re a lotbigger now than we were then, although I’m not there anymore.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You’re not at all?Bowes: Oh sure, oh sure, sure. I just don’t do the—I don’t do deals.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What do you do then if you’re not doing deals?Bowes: Well, I give advice. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And I imagine people listen!Bowes: Sometimes, yes. Sometimes they fight back. So we have partners meetings onMondays, and tomorrow we’re having an all-day strategy meeting down inMenlo Park and the same thing on Saturday.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What is this operation here in San Francisco?Bowes: This is my San Francisco office. A place to hang my hat. I don’t have to godown to Silicon Valley five days a week anymore.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see. Because you live here. I see, I see. Well, you were characterizing yourtwo original partners as being gurus in diverse areas. Did you think of yourselfas being a guru in any particular line?Bowes: No. I claimed I would take on the medical investing side.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh that seems fair enough.Bowes: They didn’t want it, and I’ve always been interested in things medical.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, because of your mother? 30Bowes: Well, I suppose. So I stuck to that with some exceptions, and we did a lot ofretail deals in those days. Our first fund was remarkably successful, whichgives you the impetus to do a second fund, et cetera, et cetera. But we becamea first-tier firm in Silicon Valley, even though we were late to the game—’81.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, particularly if you count Draper, Gaither & Anderson way back in 1958.Bowes: Well, yes, but—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You don’t count them?Bowes: No. There were lots of good firms formed up in the seventies. Like theMayfield Fund, which I helped fund, was 1973 or 1974, and so you had, therewere—I don’t know how many—there were probably twenty-five reallypretty good firms around.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, you know, we skated over, and it’s such a complicated history that it’ssort of hard to summarize it, but I’m thinking of Silicon Valley and thattremendous growth of technology, pre-biotech, which you were very muchpart of. I don’t know quite how to phrase this question, but it’s sort of achicken and egg question in a way. The technology is there and you’rebeginning to develop an infrastructure and an area where this technology ishappening, and a culture is growing up around it. Say something—it’s not avery coherent question I’m asking, but I’m trying to fit the growth of venturecapital into this phenomenon of Silicon Valley which is happening as you’removing along closer and closer to venture capital.Bowes: Well, I guess it really started with Dave Packard and Bill [William R.]Hewlett, Stanford engineers with an idea. Their professor is often called thefather of Silicon Valley, Fred [Frederick E.] Terman. Packard and Hewlettwere such exemplary citizens that they kind of set an example for what youcould, or how you could start a company and have it grow and prosper.Stanford was interested in that because it would—their engineeringdepartment would be much more interesting if it had real world experience togo with its academic credentials. So people took notice of Hewlett andPackard and they started—yes, that can happen. You can build a companyfrom nothing. And then a few people did. There were other companies downthere that started. Raychem was a decent example.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, you mention that several times. Should we talk about Raychem? Bowes: Well, no. It’s out of the mainstream. It was a chemical company as opposed toinformation technology, as opposed to a chip company or a softwarecompany. These things happen organically. One thing leads to another. It’shard to say where the watershed events are. Venture capitalists look forinteresting opportunities. Entrepreneurs hear money is available so they try toput together a team to do something earth shaking, and it just can’t happenquickly. It happens over a long period of time and there’s no magic moment,but it kept happening and kept growing and you do end up with aninfrastructure. Silicon Valley has its own kinds of lawyers, kinds of law firms.All they do is high tech. They have their own kinds of management recruitingfirms that know how to look for a great software engineer and they knowwhere these people are and who’s restless. It’s a real infrastructure. Plus theventure capitalists and the money and the networking—and Stanford’s a bigpart of it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes. How much do you buy into the more ephemeral parts of thisinfrastructure? I’m thinking of culture—in quotes—the supposed tolerance forrisk and—Bowes: Yes, it’s a big part.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is that a real phenomenon?Bowes: Oh yes. I mean—don’t be afraid to fail. You can still have a career after youfail, unlike other countries. You’re not disgraced—you just learned a lessonthat you’re going to apply next time.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Would you say that that’s unique to Silicon Valley?Bowes: I think it’s unique to Silicon Valley and other areas like Silicon Valley aroundthis country.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Any elsewhere?Bowes: Well, you see biotech startups in Boston and San Diego. You’ll see electronicstartups in Boston and Austin, Texas and somewhat Orange County, so thereare spots of this and they’re all not risk averse—that expect a certainproportion of your initiatives to fail. It just has to happen. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes. I’m imagining that this was not the sort of thing that you were beingtaught at Harvard Business School.Bowes: You are now.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, oh I bet they are now—but that must have been a radical shift in businessmodels for you.Bowes: Oh sure, sure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And everybody else that was involved.Bowes: I think the word entrepreneurship is a buzzword now. It’s deemed veryimportant to this country. Innovation and entrepreneurship are whatdifferentiate us from every place else in the world. That’s our story and we’llstick with it. And I think it’s right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you? Why?Bowes: Because look at your best Indian entrepreneurs. They’re in Silicon Valley,they’re not in India. The best. They know that they can prosper here. Theydon’t have to go for thirty-seven approvals to start a business—just get alawyer and you’re on your way. And so—it feeds on itself. Silicon Valley isfull of Chinese entrepreneurs. One of my partners is Chinese. He couldn’t dothat in China—maybe in five years. They’re getting the idea over there.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes. And is it mainly because the governmental structure is cumbersome? Oris it more—or as well, maybe is the way to put it, how people look atbusiness—again getting back to this more ephemeral culture idea of startupsand risk and making a go for it.Bowes: Well, in other countries it’s awfully hard to raise money for a high-riskstartup. Where do you go to raise the money?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Where do you go?Bowes: Good question. [laughter] No place to go. If your family doesn’t have it, youaren’t going to get it. And so it kind of stays in the family. So there’s a very strong culture in Silicon Valley that has been unique for a long time, and it’sprobably going to get less unique, but not very fast. The valley goes through, the venture capital part, goes through hard times.Turn of the century was a tough time for venture capitalists. They lost a lot ofmoney. Lots of newly formed firms had to quit because they couldn’t raisetheir second fund.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What about right now with the economic downturn?Bowes: Yes. [pause] There are two things about that. One is that when you’re startinga company, and we’re all early stagers, you have to take a long view. Youknow you’re not going to get rewarded for five years. That’s a goodsituation—five years is just wonderful. So the present situation doesn’t reallyplay much to that. Where it plays right now is your good companies in yourstable can’t go public right now, so if you’re going to realize on thosecompanies you have to sell them to a big guy, which you kind of hate to do,it’s not really what we’re in business for, but you don’t have any choice,because your investors are your bosses. You’re working for them, so peoplearen’t able right now to realize the fruits of their last five or ten years of labor.Hopefully that’ll come to an end one of these days. But we’re all optimists,and looking ahead five or ten years. It’s not going to be like this, it’s going tobe fine again and we’ll have our IPOs. And everybody will be very—sunshineon the meadow. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So you’re optimistic.Bowes: Oh sure. Everybody in this business is optimistic.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes. Well, maybe we should stop there and then we’ll pick up next time. Ithink there’s much more to say about U.S. Venture Partners.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, we left off last time—we had just talked about the founding of USVPand then we kind of got diverted into other things. So I thought today we’dbegin by picking up USVP again, not only to get that history down but also asa way of looking at your mode of doing venture capital. Does that soundgood?Bowes: Okay. [chuckling] So where were we? <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, let me pick up on something that you said last time. You said, as anintroduction to the foundation of USVP, that you had been doing venturecapital in an unusual way prior to that time, by finding situations that youthought were worth doing and—Bowes: And raising the money from other people.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Right. Well, you didn’t say that, but that was what—and so that’s what youmeant, because that was going to be my question, why unusual and was thatwhat made it unusual?Bowes: Yes, most venture capitalists, when they find an attractive situation, write acheck, and I didn’t have any checks to write. [laughter] So I had to go findpeople who might be interested in the situation, so go to five or eight ortwelve people and find three or four that were interested. To get the companyfinanced that way was not as satisfactory for the company, because it tooklonger. But sometimes they didn’t have any particular alternative, so theywaited for me to do my best—and it always worked out. I always did find themoney, and your reputation gets around as being able to perform and theydon’t have to worry so much about wasting all that time. But it got a little bitlonely, and I was here in the Bank of America building, which is forty milesfrom the action down in Silicon Valley, so the distance was a handicap. So Idecided to form a venture firm.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, well, you still had to raise the money.Bowes: Well, you can’t form a firm unless you have partners, so I got together with acouple of other guys who wanted to form a venture firm and we formed up.We did the legal papers and became a partnership and started to look forfunding. And that was in June, July of—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: 1981.Bowes: ’81. It took a long time because institutional investors aren’t eager to be thefirst ones to finance a new group. They like to go with proven entities, and soit took us until the following January, February, March, which is a good ninemonths, to get our necessary funding together.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And was it all from institutions? Bowes: Not all, but the bulk of it was. The bulk of it was. We got a huge—we had twohuge breaks in late fall—General Electric pension fund and Allstate InsuranceCompany decided to take a flier with us. That made it easier, because theywere big names and they had lots of venture capital firms in their stable, andso their blessing meant a lot.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, was it your name that validated USVP?Bowes: No, I think it was the three of us. One of my partners was a noted retailer, andwe were going to have retail as one of our initiatives, and then the otherfellow, Bob Sackman, was a well-known technologist. So he was going to dotechnology and I was going to do medical and off we go.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, when you say a technologist you mean that he had been financingtechnology or was he from a tech company?Bowes: Both. He’d had a big job at Ampex. He was number two at Ampex, and he’dalso had a small venture fund that he had actually run. He was a worthwhilepartner.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes. You know the fact that you were specializing—do I deduce from thatthat it is at least helpful, if not important, to know about the technology?Assuming that the company is a tech company, that you know somethingabout the technology.Bowes: It’s important. The entrepreneurs have more respect for you if you can talktheir language. I couldn’t talk their language. I could talk the medical talk, butI couldn’t talk the technology talk, and I couldn’t talk the retail talk either. It’snot that difficult, I just didn’t have any experience at all in retailing. So it wasa natural split, actually.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, and yet, speaking of retail, you said something last time about how in theearly days you did have a heavier investment in retail.Bowes: Yes, we told our investors we were going to do about a third, a third, a third.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And they liked that?Bowes: Yes. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because it was diversified?Bowes: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes. But when you get into those very different areas, is there anything thatchanges about your investment approach or your management approach?Bowes: Yes, it’s different because I think we were three one-man gangs, because weall had our areas. I could talk to a technologist and make up my mind whetherhe was the kind of a person I would back, but I certainly couldn’t evaluate thequality of his technology, and the same with retail. I’m pretty good at judgingpeople. That was what I brought to the party for retail and technology, and itseemed to work out.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Would you say that aside from the different areas that the three of you werespecializing in that each of you had other skills? You as a people reader, forexample, and the other two may have had—Bowes: Well, everybody thinks he’s a good people reader, so I’m not going to claimthat as an exclusive.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: No, no, but maybe you had it more in spades than they did.Bowes: That would be an opinion. [chuckling] We don’t deal with opinions, we dealwith facts. I went on retail boards; I went on technology boards, so I felt Icould contribute in a business sense, I just couldn’t tell you where they wereblowing smoke on the development of the next new thing or not.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you tend to get more excited about certain areas rather than others?Bowes: Well, I like medical the best. Doing good, doing well by doing good doesappeal to me. You can sort of see and smell the results of your investing whensome product that wasn’t there before is there now and helps people withtough problems.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So these are all things that factor into a decision to invest?Bowes: I don’t quite get that question. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, it certainly wouldn’t be, I’m imagining, the fact that a medical devicecompany is going to do good, as you put it—Bowes: Or a biotech.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Or a biotech, as the only reason that you would invest, but it might be one ofthe thoughts that goes into the whole mix of factors that you’re looking atwhen you decide to invest.Bowes: Well, I made an early decision for the firm, and it’s been held to for all theseyears that we were only going to do therapeutic investments on the medicalside.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Really. Why?Bowes: Well, that’s where you can see the good and that’s where the money is.[chuckling] It turns out that’s where the money is.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] But that must be using the term—Bowes: So we weren’t going to do hospital chains.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh I see, but when you say—Bowes: {inaudible}—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You see when you say therapeutics, I think of pharmaceuticals.Bowes: Sure you do.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And I know you’ve done more than just pharmaceutical biotechs.Bowes: Well, all biotechs are pharmaceutical, aren’t they?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: No, well, it depends on how you—Bowes: They want to be a biopharmaceutical instead of a— <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, all right, I guess if you narrowly—it depends on, I guess, on how youdefine biotech, but some people would include medical devices underbiotech—that’s stretching it.Bowes: No, but we don’t, we don’t. Very different. Biotech is biology. Devices areknives.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Okay. [laughter] That’s pretty clear.Bowes: I will grant you that in the early days of biotech, nobody knew where it wasgoing, what form—it could have been bringing up oil out of shale, little bugswith drops of oil marching it up to the surface. It could have been diagnostics.It could have been animal help, it could have been bigger pigs, fatter cows.[chuckling] Nobody knew—and so it took a while for everybody to decidethat therapeutics was the place to be. If you could actually bring a cure to thetable, you had a worthwhile product and a worthwhile initiative. And so the whole biotech industry, with the exception of a few foodcompanies that use biotechnology to improve yields, the whole biotechindustry is biopharmaceuticals, which means therapeutics. Lately you’ve hadsome branching off into biodiagnostics, as the next possible big thing, butwe’re early there.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You can see that in what the early companies were doing, because I think wetalked about Amgen having quite a diverse array of early projects whichcertainly were not all in therapeutics, and I think most of them—I knowGenentech was not strictly therapeutic. It very soon came back to therapeutics,but it certainly backs up what you were saying, people kind of testing wherethis industry might go.Bowes: Yes, in companies that came along a little bit later—went straight intotherapeutics. They didn’t screw around with other stuff.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But why was that? Was that where the most money was to be made?Bowes: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes. And then probably the very genuine motive that you yourself haveexpressed of quite obviously a socially useful product. Bowes: Yes, therapeutics. Therapeutic products.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, another thing that seems to me doubtful that people really understood inthe very beginning about biotech was how long it was actually going to take toget a drug to market. Do you remember any discussions like that?Bowes: There were undoubtedly some misconceptions. I think if you were a hardheaded realist, you realized that the Federal Drug Administration wasn’t goingto change its rules just because you called yourself a biotech. You were goingto have to go through the same rigorous three phases of testing, and so itturned out that the length of time between discovery and marketplace didn’tchange much. Ten to fifteen years. [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And worse!Bowes: And worse. Ten years to a disaster.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, well, I think too in some of those first products, me-too products isn’tquite the word to use, but they were artificial reproductions of naturalproducts—for example, growth hormone and insulin. I think one of thethoughts was that because there were products like that already on the market,and obviously approved by the FDA, that when you came along with arecombinant form of insulin, it would just flow right through.Bowes: Sail through.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: —at the FDA I mean. And, of course, as we know now, looking back, itdidn’t. The FDA looked as hard at recombinant insulin as they would havelooked at any new drug.Bowes: Yes, they demanded proof positive of medical equivalency, and it takes a longtime for proof positive to be demonstrated.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: When you were starting out, you would have been exposed a little, maybe, atCetus, but then again, Cetus wasn’t really doing therapeutics in those earlyyears, was it. I’m just—maybe it’s easier to think about Amgen starting up in1981. Do you think, at that point that you really—Bowes: 1979. 40<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling]Bowes: Really.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, okay. 1979—I guess I think of George Rathmann as being the one thatreally gets it going, but—Bowes: He came in ’80.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Okay, all right.Bowes: ’81 was the first important financing the company got, and that was January,so ’79-’80, ‘81.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Right. I stand corrected. [chuckling] Do you think, though, at that stage, thateverybody, including you, really were considering all the hurdles that a newdrug would have to go through? Was that obvious?Bowes: [pause] Well, I think we were fairly realistic about it. What we hoped was wewould have early indications of real promise in a drug, such that the financialmarket would recognize this as a real promising initiative and would financethe time required, which turned out to be true. Amgen had one, two, three,four—five or six financings from founding to drug in the market over thoseyears, and you needed every one of them, otherwise you would run out ofmoney. So if you can show promise of efficacy and promise of no safetyproblems in a drug early, the money will come.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So did each of those financings tend to follow some kind of demonstration?Bowes: No. They followed—sometimes they’re just opportune—the stock market hasa funny way of opening and closing, and you have to grab money while youcan. We did that a couple of times—just get ready and do it. I think at somepoints, say along ’86 or ’87, in there, the market was pretty sure Amgen hadan important drug and they were willing to finance the money for clinicaltrials.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was that EPO [erythropoietin]? Bowes: Yes, that was EPO. EPO was kind of a world record eight years. Eight yearsfrom company funding. Five years from discovery. To on the market in onlyfive years, which was really a record.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, yes.Bowes: Clinical trials were so definitive for that drug. You could give it to—youcould go into a hospital room, with beds on each side and you’d give the drugto those people and you wouldn’t give it to these people and they’d havedifferent skin color—pink and gray, like that [claps hands]. Pretty good.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you see that?Bowes: Yes. Pretty convincing. It made the clinical trials a little easier when it was soclear.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is it true, and I think you at the board level would have known that the EPOproject was in danger of being dropped at one stage, and that it was Rathmannwho kept the funding going for it?Bowes: It was tough science. There was discussion of dropping it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes. Did you take a stand?Bowes: [chuckling] No. That’s a scientists’ discussion.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes. So you kept your mouth shut when it was—Bowes: Well, I didn’t want him to bet the whole farm on that one project. But we hadsome very determined scientists at the lower level—heroes in this case—whojust pushed and pushed and pushed. They worked ungodly hours for many,many months and eureka! When the news came, I was brought to a biggathering of scientists for the scientist who made the breakthrough, the wholeroom got up and cheered and clapped, which was kind of nice for him. [pause]So?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] I was wondering if you were going to say more. I steered youaway from USVP again and we devolved into questions of social usefulness. Iprobably should ask you a better question or a more primary question. What, if you had to give the one most important reason for making an investment,what would you say?Bowes: Well, the most important reason for making an investment is to provide areturn for our investors. That’s what they have entrusted us to do.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Right. All right, well then, in deciding, there are many opportunities out there.Why this opportunity rather than that one?Bowes: Well, the most important single thing is—is there a big market for this productand will the market pay a decent price for this product? The number two thingis the people. The market’s more important than the people.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is that so.Bowes: You can change the people, but you can’t change the market.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So is that the first thing you look at? And you would do some research.Bowes: Yes. Our own research, consultants’ research—the research that’s been doneby the entrepreneurs is often really very good. You can validate that and youput all your resources into doing a quick evaluation. These opportunities areoften very competitive. There might be ten venture capitalists wanting toinvest in this particular team, and it doesn’t pay to wait around.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How long has that been true where there is—Bowes: It ebbs and flows.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Really.Bowes: But it’s usually true. The good groups get funded quite quickly. The moneymay not come in quickly, but the commitments get made quite quickly, and itoften adds up to more money than the entrepreneur wants to take, so he has tocut back and, say, eliminate firms or cut everybody back pro rata. So it’s a fungame.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It must be—you’re still at it. Bowes: No, I’m not.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, you are in the sense of giving advice, right?Bowes: Oh yes. I like to go to the meetings.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is it commonplace to put market ahead of people?Bowes: I don’t know if its commonplace or not, but it’s not uncommon, I’m sure. Itonly makes sense. If there’s nobody going to buy this product, why bother. Ifthere are very few people who are going to buy this product, why bother. Ithas to be—you have to look at a potential—we call it a TAM.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What does that stand for?Bowes: Total Available Market. TAM. It has to be $500 million or more to be trulyinteresting. If you have that kind of a TAM, you can have a company of a sizethat attracts attention either from acquirers or from the IPO market. That’swhat you have to have to make a return.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But it would seem to me, being a complete non-economic-proficient person,that nonetheless, even if you decide that it’s market over everything, that thereare a lot of factors that are connected with that. One that I think of, and I’msure there are more, is that if it’s really an innovative product, then how doknow?Bowes: You don’t know. You never know.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, then how are you deciding?Bowes: You have an opinion.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] You just said that venture capitalists weren’t supposed to haveopinions!Bowes: [chuckling] You got me there. If you’re talking about what a market’s goingto be four years from now, it’s all opinions. There are no facts available toyou. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, opinions and experience, though.Bowes: Yes, and research.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But you do think about all those things, because I’m imagining that there aresome markets that it’s very obvious that there’s a call for x product, thatothers you think, well, maybe, but we’re going to have to do a lot of buildingto get to the point where we’re really actually going to have a market if wecan get this product out.Bowes: And you also have to think about competitive response to a product like this.When we get to here, is Cisco going to eat our lunch? Or are we going to besomething that they can’t quite compete with, something that’s too clever forthem for the moment. So those competitive pressures are part of the marketanalysis—who’s in there now, potentially, could be right there with us andthey’re big and strong.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And what about the legal aspect, the intellectual property picture?Bowes: Well, you have to have it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, in your product—but also—Bowes: It’s a lot more important in the medical area.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, so would you look—you or your people look at what the patent situationis in x area of medicine?Bowes: Sure, of course.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And if the thicket is too dense you might decide that this isn’t the wisestinvestment?Bowes: Oh yes. Intellectual property is one of the six things you have to check off.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What are some of the others?Bowes: Size of market, [laughter]—quality of— <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That seems to be quite a theme!Bowes: Quality of team, IP—intellectual property, competitive response, speed ofmarket uptake. I mean if it’s going to be big in fifteen years, it doesn’t workfor investment purposes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because you want return in about five or eight years.Bowes: Yes, five or eight. So timing of the market—just a whole bunch of stuff likethat. It’s all the nuts and bolts of the business.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Right. All right. Could we return to number two consideration—namely, thepeople? I realize—I hear you saying that there’s a lot of intuition involved, butcan you—Bowes: A lot of research too.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, on the people’s background.Bowes: Oh yes. Intense checking.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How do you do that?Bowes: Former employers. And they hate it, because you’re not supposed tobadmouth somebody who has worked for you. It’s almost illegal.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, can’t they refuse?Bowes: Yes. You have to talk them into not refusing, so you’ve got to come in as afriend of a friend, or a friend of a friend of a friend, so that they can bepersuaded to whisper quietly the facts of the matter.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes. Is that where your name and experience might help too?Bowes: Yes, sure. We all have networks, and at a partners meeting—who knows soand so, who knows so and so, would you give him a call and see if he’ll talk tome about so and so. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And are you usually doing that yourself?Bowes: I—not anymore. Used to.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Used to though. You were really hands on doing all this.Bowes: Oh yes, we don’t have anybody else.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] So you get you the loner.Bowes: If you don’t do it, it doesn’t get done. You can’t ask an associate to try to prysensitive information out of a CEO. He’s not going to even take the call.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It’s not going to work any way.Bowes: So it’s very much hands on. It’s important to have a reputation down therethat’s pretty unqualified.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes. Which—and what goes into that unqualified?Bowes: Just your life experience with these people. They’ve dealt with you, you’vedealt with them, mutual respect, mutual liking, just the usual set ofinteractions that go on in a busy business life. You’re meeting people all thetime and you’re either favorably or unfavorably inclined, usually, and viceversa. So you have your pals and your partners have their pals and yourpartners’ pals have their pals, and it’s just a big network of pals. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And then you all go to the Bohemian Grove in the summer.Bowes: We have, let’s say, fifteen people in my firm.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Really? Partners or everybody.Bowes: Investment professionals. Two of us are Bohemians, so that’s the proportion.We probably have more Bohemians than lots of other firms. So anyway, theBohemian Club has not got much to do with Silicon Valley. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, aren’t there quite a number of people who stem from there though? Notnecessarily?Bowes: No, absolutely not. The Bohemian Club started as a journalists’ club, and ittook them ten years to deign to have businessmen in the club. Even now, ifyou’re talented or if you’re a journalist or a college professor, you’re in [clapshands]—as opposed to waiting fifteen years. And you’re in for a song, so—it’s very biased, in a sense. Populationwise, it’s very biased against business,which is what makes it fun. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] You’re the renegades?Bowes: Not quite that bad.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: All right. Well, I pulled some things off your Website if I can find it—[soundof shuffling papers]. All right.Bowes: This is USVP?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: USVP. Quote—“Bowes’s belief that venture capitalists should guidecompanies based on real world experience continues to set the tone at USVP.”Real world experience meaning in actually investing and managing companiessuccessfully?Bowes: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That seems to me to be a given. Presumably you said that—Bowes: I didn’t write that.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: No. [chuckling] But your name is connected with it. I was just wondering ifthere was more to it than that—that it was a way of trying to distinguishUSVP from the rest of the world, as though maybe there is another way ofdoing it.Bowes: [pause] Well, we like to think as a firm that we have fairly unique capabilitiesin helping managements achieve their goals. We always think of ourselves,after we’ve written the check, as unpaid consultants. Our consulting is muchmore important than the checkwriting, in our view. So we advise and consult and we help with contacts. We help with recruiting; we help choose lawyers;we help choose accountants; we help choose investment bankers. We’re justall over the company in a—hopefully non-interfering, but always constructiveand helpful, way. I think we think we’re pretty good at this. I’m not sayingother firms aren’t, because they are, but we just want to make it clear that wethink we are. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So that’s what that statement means.Bowes: I guess so, yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But it does give a certain advantage to partnerships that have been around fora while.Bowes: Sure, sure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Who can look back on considerable years of experience. So it makes mewonder—is the venture capital industry, and I think we can call it an industrythese days, can’t we?Bowes: Sure. A small industry.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: A small industry. Again, with economic downturn what I’m going to sayprobably doesn’t make too much sense, but what I’m thinking—are theopportunities to invest so great that it opens the field to newer venturecapitalists and newer venture capital partnerships that in the old days, justbecause they were new and inexperienced, might have had a hard timebreaking in?Bowes: That happens from time to time. I think the most notable time was in the latenineties, early 2000, when the first Internet wave came along and you hadventures and venture firms springing up in great numbers. You had kids atHarvard Business School starting a business before they graduated and gettingmoney, and there was a horrendous failure rate from all that. Then, as we liketo say, all the tourists went home, and we got back to the good old boys who’dbeen doing it all along. So what you mostly find in terms of new firms is people who have hived offfrom other firms. Say, our group of twelve, and three of them are moreambitious than being in this firm and they want to go off and do their own andthey’re experienced. So they’re really an experienced firm even thoughthey’re a startup. So it’s hard to get into this business without putting in your time. Our young guys, our associates are—they’re experienced. They’veworked in industry. They’re experienced and now they’re learning the venturecapital business and getting even more experience and one of these daysthey’ll be a partner. It’s hard to bypass the process. It’s just hard. Bob and Stu and I, we got away with it because we were fifty-plus years oldand we had a successful life experience in each case. People gambled on us asa team, but it’s hard for a thirty-five year old to say that. So the way forwardfor young people is to get with the firm and learn the business.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And what about the importance of an MBA?Bowes: [pause] I think work experience is more important. If you had a goodmarketing job at Intel, that beats an MBA. An MBA is a little bit general forthe venture business. Later on, it’s fine, but it’s not the exact profile you needto have to get hired by a good firm.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I had questions about distinguishing USVP from other venture capitalpartnerships, but I’m imagining you’ve more or less answered that. It’s thisbasis on experience and operating experience particularly, would you say?Bowes: Operating experience and investing experience. We just raised our tenth fund,so the combined operating and investment experience of the group goes backnow for twenty-five years. It gets easier to sell yourself as you move forward.[chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you have any preference in terms of being a lead investor?Bowes: Yes. We much prefer to be a lead investor.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And why is that?Bowes: We trust ourselves. [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Very good! If you don’t, who does?Bowes: Right, but there are ten or a dozen other firms that we’re—we’re okay ifthey’re the lead. We’d much prefer to be the lead or the co-lead, but we willdo a deal if they’re the lead, and we like the deal. There are other firms thatwe wouldn’t. No names [chuckling]. 50<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But is there a pattern in the mix with whom you would choose to associate?Bowes: Every firm has its patterns. The people you are comfortable with, the keypeople you’ve had success with become your trading partners. If you’relooking for partners, and most of us don’t do an entire transaction byourselves—if you’re looking for partners, you look for people you can workwith and you look for people who have particular expertise in this kind of aproject. Those are the two criteria, and we pretty much stick by those two.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And the reason that you want partners is more money and spread the risk?Bowes: Spread the risk and spread the work. As I said, we’re unpaid consultants andit’s nice if you can spread that around.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes. Well, you know—I also have questions about more on the hands-on, theactual management of the company, but the way we could handle that is bylooking at some of the specific companies that we ticked last time as worthyof discussion?Bowes: Okay.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I’m wondering about the nitty gritty of after you’ve decided to invest and nowyou want to get this company off the ground and you’ve talked about the veryearly stages, being involved in hiring expertise in various areas. But whatabout at a slightly different stage, when this new company is actuallybeginning to function? What is your role there? Should we look at specificcompanies, or do you want to talk more generally?Bowes: I think it’s probably easier to look at specific companies.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Okay. Well, the first one that happens to be ticked—I don’t know the actualchronology of your investments, but Applied Micro Circuits [Corporation],which, of all the ones that you wanted to talk about, as far as I can tell, is theonly one that is not a Bay Area company.Bowes: True.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is that somewhat of an anomaly? Do you prefer to have companies closer athand? Bowes: We like to be able to visit our companies and get back home the same day. SoSan Diego is a bit far, but—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, Canada is even further, isn’t it?Bowes: Pardon me.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, although this is British Columbia, wasn’t it?Bowes: Which?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Applied Micro Circuits is in Canada, right?Bowes: No, it’s in San Diego.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh, oh.Bowes: Must be a different company with a similar name.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: All right. Oh, I’m sorry about that. I Googled Applied Micro Circuits and Igot a company in British Columbia.Bowes: Well, maybe there is another {unintelligible}. We call it AMCC. If youGoogled AMCC, you might get San Diego. Applied Micro Circuits, AMCC.That’s its stock ticker, that name.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Would you want to talk about that investment and your hands-on role?Bowes: What are some of the other ones?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Advanced Cardiovascular Systems, Applied Biosystems, Sun Microsystems,and Ventritex. Those were the ones that you indicated you might want to talkabout.Bowes: I’d rather talk about some of those, because they were closer to home and youcould actually spend more time.  Well, Applied Biosystems. I’d heard about a professor at Caltech who had amachine in his basement he’d invented that was supposed to do great things.So I went down to see him and sure enough—he had one which he and acouple of his lab assistants had put together. It was a gene sequencer which—gene sequencing had been very laborious to do. It took hundreds of hours.This thing speeded it up by at least a hundred times, and this was veryimportant for research, gene sequencing, and—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: This must be Lee Hood.Bowes: Yes. I went to see him, and he was wearing lederhosen in the office. [laughter]My kind of guy!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you find that—your intuition was probably working on that one.Bowes: No, we had no idea for Lee to manage the company. It took a year to get thatmachine out of the clutches of Caltech. They were very anti-business.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were they?Bowes: Yes, as a sort of a mindset, but eventually we got it to where we could form acompany, and we immediately moved it to the Bay Area and we found aperson who was working at Hewlett-Packard whose life experience there wastaking machines that the scientists had dreamed up at Hewlett-Packard andsort of thrown over the wall to be developed into a commercial version. So hedecided that this was a really worthwhile thing to do. So he left HewlettPackard, became the chief executive office at Applied Bio and turned themachine into an industrial product. The biotech companies were really excitedby the prospect of this machine.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I’ll bet.Bowes: So they paid real money to get on a waiting list for a machine that had neverbeen built. [chuckling] A little persuasion there—and so it avoided a lot offinancing that we would have otherwise had—that would have been dilutive.Sure enough it became a product and it became a company. One of the nicethings about the machine was that it required reagents to work, and so thatwas a steady revenue stream of reagents revenue.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Which Applied Biosystems was supplying. Bowes: Making, yes. It was very successful and went public and did fine andeventually was acquired by a big guy. I think the big guy changed his name toApplied Biosystems. It was just bought recently, and it was a big success.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: When you first went down to see Lee Hood, did he already know that he hadsomething that was commercializable?Bowes: No. He thought it was going to be a laboratory instrument.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see. So did you have to do some fast talking?Bowes: He was pretty receptive to the thought of making money [laughter]—andseeing his machine used broadly.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Used. It was so—Bowes: Because he felt it would advance the whole industry.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, which it did. Had he patented it? Or had the university patented it?Bowes: We went to work.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, right away. But that’s another indication that he hadn’t thought about—Bowes: He hadn’t, no. But he saw the virtue of doing that very quickly. He was aquick study.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did he eventually become directly involved with Applied Bio?Bowes: No, never.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Never. He remained—well, he’s not at Caltech anymore, is he.Bowes: No, he was a spiritual father and a pretty big stockholder, too. He wasavailable for scientific advice if something happened, but the guy we found atHewlett-Packard was so good that we didn’t really have to call on Lee for much of anything. He was hired away from Caltech by the University ofWashington.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That’s right.Bowes: Bill Gates funded a whole big laboratory for him, so that was a good careermove for Lee.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, it was, and then the Human Genome Project came along as well.Bowes: Well, although his machines did a lot on that, he wasn’t that involvedpersonally. He finally decided that he couldn’t get done what he wanted to getdone inside of a university, so he’s founded his own institute up in Seattle.Institute for Systems Biology.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Really—and actually laboratory machines—or developing laboratorymachines?Bowes: Doing intense research on the next wave of predictive and preventativemedicine.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And he couldn’t do it in the university because he couldn’t get funding?Bowes: No. Because he couldn’t move at the speed he had to move, in his view. Toomany people had to approve every project, and it just drove him nuts.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That’s interesting, though, isn’t it. Because you hear a lot about theindustrialization of the university—at least you do on the Berkeley campus,with BP and a lot of corporate investment, and yet there remains quite adistinction, does there not, between academia and the business world?Bowes: You had many riots over there, didn’t you, with the BP thing?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, oh yes, we’re known for that. We also like oak trees. [laughter][technical interruption to change tape][End Audio File 3]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: All right. Is that enough about Applied Bio?Bowes: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Would you like to talk about another one?Bowes: We can talk about ACS—if you know what that stands for.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Advanced Cardiovascular Systems.Bowes: And do you know what that is, or was?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I know it makes or made medical devices, and it’s located in SantaClara. That’s not very much, is it, so I hope you can fill in! [chuckling]Bowes: When I got involved, it was located in Mountain View, which is pretty close.It was kind of a classic marriage of Silicon Valley technology with unmetmedical needs. What they put together there was a [microphone rubbingsounds] device for angioplasty. Do you know angioplasty?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes.Bowes: Well, all of the bypass operations that were being done, heart bypass, all ofthem were unnecessary, because the patient wasn’t that sick, but there was noalternative. So this angioplasty, which had been invented by a guy inSwitzerland, but he had never come up with a really good product—heinvented the process, really. So we set out to really do a first-class angioplastymachine, and we did.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But how had you even heard of the Swiss device?Bowes: Oh, in reading.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So you found it and thought this was something that should be developed.Bowes: No, that was later. A friend of mine found it and persuaded me that it shouldbe developed, and I agreed. We found some really brilliant technicians whogot the job done, and then we found a brilliant CEO—he was from San Diego—either Orange County or San Diego. The whole thing fit very wellwith his business smarts and the technological achievements of thetechnicians. We got that company going in ’84, I guess, and it really took off.The reason it took off, to be perfectly honest, was that it gave doctors whoweren’t so fantastic a chance to do a procedure that was lifesaving or lifeenhancing, and do it more than once a day. So we provided seminars fordoctors to learn how to do it here, three days by operating on pigs.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You mean literally at the partnership?Bowes: No—we would rent some space. And they had to pay their own way, the docs.So that was a profit center, [laughter] because we had a waiting list of docsthat wanted to learn how to do this procedure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, who were coming from all over?Bowes: All over, all over. There was a doc in Kansas City three years later who wasmaking more money that [Michael E.] DeBakey.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh my heavens.Bowes: He was doing four or five a day and charging $15,000 per. [chuckling] Notbad! And that really got going beautifully, and then one of the bigpharmaceutical companies noticed it and decided they wanted to get into thedevice business and they bought it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Who was that?Bowes: Eli Lilly.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see. And it’s still a going part of their operation?Bowes: Well, Eli Lilly put together a number of device companies, and then theydecided that they wanted to separate their device companies from thepharmaceutical, and they spun it out into a separate corporation to theirstockholders. It became a company called Guidant.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh. Yes. Bowes: ACS was the most important part of Guidant, always. Guidant was just sold acouple of years ago to Boston Scientific for some ungodly [laughter] amountof money, but we did fine on that investment. It was a very good success.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And is it—did it have an effect, [a siren in the background] I’m imagining, onthe number of bypass operations? Did they go down because—Bowes: Yes, oh yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: There was now an alternative. An easier alternative.Bowes: Yes, it got very flat.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes. Interesting. I didn’t know that.Bowes: We also had a company a little later which does minimally invasive heartbypass operations. Instead of breaking open your chest and attaching a vein upto here, to here, you go in through the ribs and you do it with robotic devices.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh really. I haven’t—Bowes: You have a screen and you tweak the device looking at the screen and thenyou—the patient goes home the next day.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: My heavens.Bowes: That’s now about 20 or 25 percent of the bypass market.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is it!Bowes: The problem with that—this was called CardioThoracic Systems. Theproblem with that company, for investment success, was that the older docscouldn’t do it. [chuckling] They didn’t have the videogame experience, thehand-eye coordination.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, I can imagine! Bowes: They knew knives, and so you had to wait for the next generation—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: To come up.Bowes: —of docs that did this. And so we sold the company because we justcouldn’t—we couldn’t afford to wait a decade for the whole population toshift over.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, you can see how that would be a very different sort of thing!Bowes: Oh yes, it’s pretty intuitively obvious.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes. It’s sort of a—I see a parallel, maybe not a terribly accurate one in—oneof my sons is an architect, and he got jobs rather easily in the beginning,mundane jobs, but in architectural firms, because he could do CAD—computer assisted design, and the older guard wasn’t used to—they were usedto hand drawing their architectural elevations.Bowes: Well, these big-time international architects have massive CAD operations.It’s one of their strengths. They all do—have computer rooms that arecranking away.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh yes, yes, but you see—that’s a newer generation that’s doing that sort of—Bowes: These are old guys, but they were smart enough to hire the young guys.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh yes, yes. Well, my son found that out! [chuckling]Bowes: How’s he doing? How’s he doing?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh he’s doing fine. He’s now out on his own!Bowes: By himself?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes. I was scared, but he seems to have more business than he can handle. Bowes: I have a friend who has a son who’s out on his own—Pfau, [spells]. Theyprobably know of each other.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: They probably do. All right. Let’s—if you don’t mind, talk very generallyabout venture capital per innovation, which I think anybody who knows theindustry at all would agree with. But perhaps what there might be someargument about is why that is. Putting it simplistically—is the innovation thatcomes from venture capital, or can come from venture capital investment, dueto the process by which firms are selected? Or, and perhaps as an and/or—is itthe management that venture capitalists such as yourself give to the new firmthat accounts, at least in part, for the innovative outcome.Bowes: It’s absolutely the combination. We would be nowhere without the innovators.They have the ideas.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, right.Bowes: We don’t have the ideas. We have thoughts, but not ideas. Sometimes we havethoughts that are pretty definite, and we go out and try to find people whomight think the same way, but the innovators are the ones that are the bedrockand we’re there to help them succeed. They all want to succeed. Some of themwant to succeed professionally and financially, and some of them want tohave a product that they can be remembered for. There are all kinds ofmotives. But you get people coming from all over the world, innovators, to be inSilicon Valley, and we welcome that certainly. All of our CEOs are not fromthe U.S. originally. It feeds on itself. Once the rhetoric was laid years ago, andit’s sort of been building and building and building, organically, innovators,financial success, more innovators, financial success, and it’s just[coughing]—it can be said, I think, with truth, that innovation is whatseparates this country from others. I think Silicon Valley, and other venturecapitalized areas less so, are really pretty importantly involved in that. If therewas no way for these young tigers to succeed, they’d do something else, and Ithink it would just be a dream, so it’s really an incredibly mutually beneficialsituation. We all think it’s great for the country, competitively.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you find that, in general, the people that come from elsewhere tend tostay? Or is there a movement to get something started and then take it back tothe home country. 60Bowes: On the whole they tend to stay. They like it here. They’re usually young.When they start, they’re usually thirty, thirty-five, forty. Their kids grow uphere and go to school here, and they get pretty entrenched. A few go home butit’s the exception. That’s not true of college students. A lot of the collegegraduates go home because opportunities are opening up in China, India. Ifyou’re a scientist that wants to be a scientist, you’re not interested inentrepreneurship, you might as well go home—probably less competitive backthere for what you want to do, but the entrepreneurs that have startedcompanies that either failed or succeeded—if they failed they want to tryagain. They’ll tend to stay here.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You hear a lot about how America is falling behind in terms of science andtechnical education. Do you see any signs of that in terms of the innovativecapacity of young Americans these days? Maybe looking back over yourcareer?Bowes: I think it’s too soon to feel the effects of it. I think you can see the precursorsof it. You can see that the engineering class at Berkeley, graduate engineeringclass, is two-thirds Asian. A lot of those guys and gals are not going to stay.They’re going to go home right away. That’s a brain drain, and of course,particularly the Far East—the Indias and the Chinas and the Singapores andthe Koreas—Taiwan—they bet their whole country on innovation, in a sense.They just feel they’ve got to be there, so their educational system doesn’t kidaround and their parents don’t kid around. Those kids hustle, and I think we’regetting out-hustled, which is not a good thing. We don’t see it in the venture capital business because so many of the smartIndians come here—even from India. They get educated over there, like oneof the founders of Sun, Vinod Khosla, who was educated in the highesttechnological college in India, went to Carnegie Mellon for more computertraining, and then went to Stanford Business School, and he’s been here eversince. And that goes for lots and lots and lots of foreign-born, but the nextgeneration is what worries you.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, yes.Bowes: It worries a lot of people. I think at the Bohemian Grove in the last couple ofweeks, I must have heard three talks about this by very highly placedpeople—very worried.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: With any suggestions about what to do about it? Aside from just worry? Bowes: Everybody knows what the problems are, it’s just that they seem insolvable. Itstarts at home.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Right. And that’s pretty hard to get to, isn’t it.Bowes: It’s pretty hard to get to.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: This is a really general question, so you can drop out or say it’s absurd to tryto answer it, but is there something that you can say about how venture capitalis, as we think of it now, a phenomenon of the last sixty years, maybe, if youstart with ’58—what has been its effect? Do you want some water?Bowes: [coughing] Yes, I’d like some water. Thank you.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: —its effect on the American and the specifically Californian economy? Is thatan impossible question?Bowes: Well, you just have to look at the companies that have resulted from venturecapital to realize it has made a huge difference in the competitive effect on bigcompanies, of these other littler companies. It has a huge effect in wakingthem up, so I think it’s had a big uplifting effect on the American economy. InCalifornia, first, of course, but the country, too. [coughing]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I’d like to hear about some of your nonprofit activities, but before we go there,would you like to say more about the venture capital aspect of your life?Bowes: It’s hard work; it’s a lot of fun; it can be rewarding; it’s good for the country. Ijust feel lucky to have been as involved as I have been. No regrets. I did a lotof commuting.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, it seems to me—Bowes: The only thing I regret is the commute.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Hmm?Bowes: The only thing I regret is the commute. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh, well, that’s relatively minor. The gas prices weren’t as bad as they arenow. I know you’ve done many things in the nonprofit world, and one of themthat seemed, in my mind, to be connected to the educational part of it—Bowes: Three in Berkeley.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes?Bowes: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Really, like what?Bowes: Well, I haven’t started one yet, but I’ve committed to it. One’s called theBerkeley Incentive Awards, which started as an experiment here in town.What we did was to pick the best kid out of each public high school in SanFrancisco. By best it means scholastic drive and he had to be poor, he or shehad to be poor. Twelve schools here, pick that best kid and send him toBerkeley for four years, everything paid. That was an experiment, and we hada great committee to select the kids and great mentoring over at Berkeley forthe kids. Now it’s statewide, almost. We have hundreds of kids in Berkeley,Berkeley Incentive Awards, four years, full boat. When we go to San Jose, we find San Jose money that will support this, samething in L.A., same thing in Salinas, same thing in Oakland, so it’s brought aterrific bunch of kids to Berkeley that couldn’t have gotten there, and they’vedone well, gotten a 99 percent graduation rate and a really good after-schoolrecord.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How long has it been going?Bowes: Oh God—I guess it’s a dozen years now.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And so you follow after graduation what becomes of these children and youngadults?Bowes: Oh sure we do. We have a big dinner every May. They come and we come.It’s really heartwarming, hear some stories. It’s really something. The otherone—I’ve got an arrangement but we’re going to start later in the year withProfessor Tijan and that’s going to be—if he finds a young person he really wants to get to Cal and needs some program money, I’ll provide the programmoney for that—maybe one or two or three a year.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: For graduate school? Or what level.Bowes: Post-grads—but exceptional. They have to be embarked on a project whichlooks like it might be exciting but needs resources, and it’s too early forgovernment resources, it’s too early for Berkeley resources, so it’s Tijan and Iwill choose the person, and I’ll provide the funding for three years for thatperson to see if what he’s got is really something.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, good.Bowes: That’ll be fun.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why Tijan? Did you know him before this got started?Bowes: Oh I’ve met him. I’ve met him, and then several times he came after me andsuggested this. I guess he pressed my button. [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And then there’s a third one connected with Berkeley, right?Bowes: That’s a prep school pointed at Berkeley, in Berkeley. It’s just getting started,so it’s too soon to declare success. We’re working on it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It’s not Maybeck, is it?Bowes: No, it’s not Maybeck.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Another educational foray of yours is the Exploratorium. How did you getinvolved?Bowes: Oh it’s always a friend. It was a friend who was already involved. Well, I justlike what they’re doing there, trying to solve our problem by getting kidsinterested in science at an early age, catching them early. The Exploratoriumis completely interactive. You’ve got 500 exhibits out there, and they’re allinteractive and the kids just eat them up. The second part of it is we teachteachers how to teach science. We have several hundred a year come, twoweek crash course. When they go back they feel much more comfortable teaching science than they did before. What we’ve observed with thoseteachers is they stay teachers. They don’t drop out, as opposed to the usual—you know what the average is? Four years.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh, well you can understand why considering what they are up against.Bowes: Right. Yes, I’m involved in Teach for America too. You know that one?Teach for America?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I know of it, yes.Bowes: It’s a great organization. There’s a relatively new book out called Forces forGood:[ The Six Practices of High-Impact Nonprofits], which is a consultant’sview of the most effective nonprofits in the country, not including universitiesand that sort of thing, but other types. Teach for America is one of the twelve.They picked twelve. Teach for America is one. Exploratorium is another.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh really!Bowes: Yes! I’m involved in a third that’s on that list—it’s Environmental Defense[Fund]. That’s a great organization.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you have a connection with it as well?Bowes: Yes, I’m on the board. They go about environmental change, I think, the rightway. They try to make things happen, together, they don’t do the—if youknow what I mean.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It’s collaborative rather than pontification.Bowes: Their motto is “Finding the Ways that Work.” That’s what they try to do, andI think they’re really good. They have an office here in town. It’s not theirmain office, but—one of the guys out here—his project at EnvironmentalDefense is to reverse the decline in the fish population. It’s worthwhile. Howdo you do that? Well, you do that by getting groups of fishermen, that have anarea, to not be greedy for the long-term sake. Take a measured catch, no more,and lo and behold, the fish come back! It’s amazing. It happens every time,and it’s a hard sell.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I bet. Bowes: Because these guys are in it for a living. But it’s taken hold in a few areas, andnow we’ve got some things we can point to as successful. We’re hoping to usethat to ever increase the number of converts.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You spent some time talking about Berkeley, but I know you have probablyeven, at least longer-term connections with UCSF?Bowes: Oh no. Berkeley goes back a long time before.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Does it, does it.Bowes: My father and my uncle were twin brothers, and all of his kids went toBerkeley.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see.Bowes: All of my father’s kids went to Stanford. So I spent a lot of time at Berkeley,because that’s where all the pretty girls were [laughter] during my Stanfordyears.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But you have—you’ve been on the board of directors at UCSF?Bowes: It’s the board of directors of the [UCSF] Foundation.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Of the foundation, right. And you still are?Bowes: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes. Were you involved in some of the work to get Mission Bay going?Bowes: Yes. I was chairman of the—well, it worked—it was a big fundraising andpart of it was for Mission Bay. I was in charge of that part, chairman of thatcommittee. We raised a lot of money and Mission Bay is up and going. Haveyou been down there?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes. I’ve done some interviewing down there. Bowes: Have you. Quite a place now, isn’t it?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, yes. And the person that hooked me on biotech was Bill Rutter whohappened to be the first person that I interviewed in biotech. Of course, he’smoved down not so much as a biochemist—but I suppose you would call himan entrepreneur now.Bowes: Oh sure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes.Bowes: Well, it all—when I was working getting Amgen started, we asked Bill to beon our scientific board of advisors, and he said he would. Then some venturecapitalists sung sweet songs to him, and he decided to start his own company![laughter] Which is fine. He did fine, and the community center there isnamed for him.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Right, yes.Bowes: William J. Rutter. In May the Exploratorium chose Bill as their person of theyear.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh did they!Bowes: For their annual fundraising dinner.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I didn’t know that.Bowes: I had the pleasure of introducing Bill to the crowd of 600 people. He said,what did he say—“If it weren’t for Bill Bowes, I wouldn’t have gotten theidea to start Chiron.” [chuckling] So I guess I—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes. Well, there’s some truth in that you know.Bowes: There probably is some truth in that.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because it was Amgen, I think—well, it was probably a little bit more thanAmgen, but certainly Amgen gave him the momentum, didn’t it. Bowes: Yes, I think so. He’s a great guy. He’s a terrific fellow.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, yes. Let’s see. Oh there are a lot of them, aren’t there. One that—whereis it now—oh there’s QB3 too, which brings in all those universities, doesn’tit.Bowes: Just three, just three.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: QB—Bowes: QB3.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, QB3 [chuckling].Bowes: Three universities.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, that brings in three. Right. The one that seems a little bit different—well,no, there are several that are a little bit different. I’m looking at the SanFrancisco Conservatory of Music and the Asian Art Museum and GraceCathedral. All, as far as I know, non-scientific, non-medical.Bowes: Well, I think you’d say that the conservatory was education.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh right.Bowes: Grace is just a great place.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is that your church?Bowes: Yes. What I like about it is it’s so inclusive. Everybody’s welcome. It’s notwhat I grew up with as an Episcopal Church, which is fairly strict and straight,but it’s—come on in and we’ll help you improve your life. [chuckling] I’mjust—I [unintelligible, microphone rubbing and banging sound]. I got talkedinto the Asian Art Museum by a friend.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You didn’t have any particular interest in Asian art? Bowes: Oh I like it, but I’m not a real aficionado.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why the Conservatory of Music?Bowes: Classical music education is particularly important because it’s not as popularas it used to be, and I think it needs support. We have a great president there,and we had a project of moving the conservatory, which is now done. It wasout on 19th Avenue in the fog, and now it’s down amongst the other music andart. It’s down near the Opera House, near the symphony, and it’s bigger. Itsnew location has made them able to attract more and better students, so it’sbeen a big success, the move.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, we’re coming to the end. Is there anything you would like to add?Bowes: Nothing in particular. It’s been a pleasure talking with you.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Thank you.Bowes: I hope I haven’t left too many gaps in the story, and I hope it fits in with yourother interviews and gives a decently broad picture. Everybody comes at itdifferently, of course. I wasn’t as early as your other interviewees, but I wasobserving it before I got there.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes.Bowes: So I do have that perspective. I’ll be really interested in reading whatevercomes out of this. Is it going to be a book?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Maybe. The first step is to get it all transcribed and then eventually up on theWeb and then it’s fair game. [chuckling]Bowes: [chuckling] Uh oh!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I thank you, it’s been a pleasure and very interesting for me.Bowes: Well, thank you. It’s been a pleasure for me.
