Interviewer: Mr. Myers—it is September 9, 2008 and this is our first session of maybe two.Would you start with what it was like to grow up in you family, and then gointo your education?Myers: Born in 1942, grew up and raised in St. Louis, went to high school there andthen left in 1960 to go to Dartmouth and studied engineering at Dartmouth.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why engineering?Myers: I’ve always loved engineering and so that’s kind of always been on theagenda. My choices were Dartmouth and Princeton. I kind of liked the liberalarts orientation of Dartmouth and so I went there. And I must say from thetime I left St. Louis, I knew I’d never go back. It was a great place to grow upand it was kind of one of these Old South things where for Labor Day andMemorial [Day] weekend, three generations would get together, a crowd offifty or sixty, which was magnificent. But it was also St. Louis, and it was hotin the summers and cold in the winter, and I just knew that wasn’t for me.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What did your parents do?Myers: My dad was [in] the insurance business and my mom raised us.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How many of you?Myers: Two. I have a brother who is five years younger.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And what happened at Dartmouth? Anything that set a career direction?Myers: Well, yes. I liked Dartmouth, studied engineering, as I said. Dartmouthengineering was a five-year program. You get an AB after four years and a BSafter five. So it was May of my senior year, someone just said, “You know—you’d be great at business. Why don’t you go to business school?” And youdon’t know how these things happen, but it just clicked like, “You’re right!That’s what I should be doing!” And so I quickly applied to Stanford, the onlyplace I wanted to go, to see if I could get in, but May, obviously, was late toget into business school. My backup was to study English at Newbury Upon Tyne in England. That was the craziest thing in the world, because I’m not anEnglish person! [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why did you even think of that?Myers: Just to do something totally different and crazy. And I got accepted there. So Iapplied to Stanford to go in the following fall. I hadn’t taken the boards; Ihadn’t done anything. I took the boards in July, did okay, nothing special. Iwas waitlisted, and then in August, a good friend and I were traveling aroundthe West, camping, and we got to California. Actually, I’d been here oncebefore to San Francisco. We came out here to this area and stayed with afriend and I said, “Well, I’ll go by Stanford. I haven’t heard from them. Iwonder if I got in.” So I went down, and they said, “We just sent you a letter.You got in.” [chuckling] So this was the end of August.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Not much notice.Myers: Yes. I went back to St. Louis and I packed up my things and came out toStanford.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now did Stanford Business School have a good reputation? Why did youchoose Stanford?Myers: It was so-so. It was okay, but it wasn’t where it is today. It was a muchsmaller school. Ernie [Ernest C.] Arbuckle was the dean at that time. A greatguy. But anyway, it was growing in reputation. The main reason was that Iwanted to come to the West Coast. I’d had it with the East Coast, both interms of mentality and how the East Coast people look at things sometimes,and as well the cold weather. Also, Dartmouth was very isolated then, sodating was just impossible at Dartmouth. The nearest girls’ school was a onehour drive or two-hour drive. Boston was four hours then. Today it’s like anhour and a half. So anyway, I just thought this is an abnormal environment. Iwant to go someplace where there are women, and so my only choice wasStanford. I got in somehow.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Very serious objectives.Myers: Yes. [chuckling] A number of sort of serendipity things happened in my life.Like, how did I make a decision on the spot to go to business school and thenat the last minute to get in, and so forth. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you have any idea why that idea clicked?Myers: No, I don’t. [chuckling] Well, it’s a totally different subject, but I think we’revery much guided by energies and forces that we don’t have much touch with.So I think part of one’s ability to flow with life and not be swimmingupstream, not be fighting life all the time, is to somehow find a way to makethose decisions. When something comes along, it’s just there for you. You justknow it. That’s the right thing. I don’t know why. It was very clear to me.That was the thing to do.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I’m guessing that this may feed in a little bit to your later career?Myers: My venture capital story, yes. How I got into venture capital is unlikeanybody else, I think.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You went to Stanford Business School. Did you have any particular directionin mind?Myers: There’s a good reason why you don’t go directly from college to businessschool, because you have no clue what you’re doing and where you want togo. I mean, I really didn’t. I went through business school kind of like college,but I didn’t really get it, because I hadn’t worked in business. I’d had summerjobs as a laborer in St. Louis. That’s all I’d done. So it’s too bad. It was a greatschool and many good connections, and so forth. But there’s a good reasonthat you spend two or three years working before you go back to businessschool.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes.Myers: So when I looked for a job after business school, I think I interviewed thirtycompanies. All the way from insurance to oil to retail—all over the map!Because I didn’t know. I ended up going to Hewlett-Packard, because it didresonate with my background—they wanted an engineering background. Theybrought people into a product management kind of role, where you could usesome of your new business skills but also use your engineering skills. So Ithought, Oh fine, that makes sense to me. I could sort of grab it, because Ididn’t really know. Hewlett-Packard was great. That was a fabulous choice.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Are we now in the late sixties? Myers: Yes. I graduated in ’66. So Hewlett-Packard right after business school, in theengineering development group. I was there for a couple of years—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, since [William] Hewlett and [David] Packard are such huge names, didyou have personal encounters with them?Myers: Yes, it was a small company then. I remember Bill Hewlett coming on the PAsystem and announcing that they had just crossed $300 million in revenue.That’s kind of where they were. They had a few other facilities in Boston andPennsylvania, but most of it was right here. They hadn’t gotten into thecomputer business yet, at that time.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh really.Myers: So this was oscilloscope spectrum analyzers and a lot of test equipment—theoriginal Hewlett-Packard business. Actually I didn’t interact much. We werelocated in a laboratory called One Upper, this new group of MBAs, and wewere given a variety of projects, two-month projects. But it was right adjacentto what they called HP Labs, the main labs. They were developing the HPcalculator, which in its first version was about the size of a typewriter. It wasquite big; this was Bill Hewlett’s pet project. So he would be there every nightat 9, 10, 11 o’clock in the lab, just him working on this calculator. And sooccasionally we were there late, not that often; we would see him, but I didn’tget to know him there. The Vietnam War was going on, and I thought that Hewlett-Packard, as amilitary supplier, would be able to get a deferment for me. Well, it turns out,they never processed the deferment; they didn’t do it properly, and so all of asudden, I got a notice to sign-up for basic training and go to war, which Ididn’t want to do. Another piece of serendipity is that when I wasinterviewing after business school, I went to interview at Fireman’s FundInsurance. I don’t know why. My dad was [in] insurance, but I couldn’t careless about insurance. I met a man; I can’t remember his name. And we had anice talk and I mentioned the war and deferment. He said, “Well, if you everneed to get into reserves at the Presidio, use my name.” The name might popin my head in a minute. This happened at Hewlett-Packard and I thought, Oh my God. So at that time,the reserves were all closing, because everybody was running to the reservesto get out of the war. And this Presidio had closed. So I called—it was Mr.Mortimer. So I called the head guy there who turned out to be the commanderof the West Coast; I didn’t know that. I said, “Mr. Mortimer said for me to call you, that he wanted me to get in the reserves.” He said, “Okay. Show uptomorrow; you’re in.”<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Just like that.Myers: So I went up there and signed up and got in the reserves, I guess, by the skinof my teeth. It was weeks later I would have been drafted, so another one ofthose fortunate turns of life. I left pretty quickly and did the reserve thing for four months. It’s normallysix, but we went down to Texas and then to Arizona, Fort Huachuca anddifferent places. It was kind of a fun group. In our group everybody had agraduate degree and we were the typing pool. Everybody knew why we werethere—we were there to avoid the war. So they did the typing thing and getout and get on with things. But we had a good time; it was a great group. Wewere the best typists, the best athletes. The best at everything we did there. Ibrought my car down to the base, and we’d go off base every weekend andparty and drive around, so it wasn’t too bad. After four months they let us out.I went back to Hewlett-Packard.What was happening then was that HP was getting into the computer business,because Digital Equipment [Corporation] a couple of years earlier had startedtheir small computer business. IBM had the big things, but [HP had a] smallcomputer business. And so it really was very much Hewlett and Packard wholed HP into the computer business.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why did they think that the time was right to get into it?Myers: Well, I just didn’t know them well enough to [know why they might] thinkthat way, but they were both forward-thinking people. I think Bill Hewlett hadbeen working on the calculator and saw the computing power that was comingalong, and DEC was already out there with the PDP-8, which was verysuccessful. They had, I think, $25 million in revenue their first year or two. Soit was kind of like, this is going to be important. So they started a new divisioncalled the Dymec Division then, which was down on the intersection of ElCamino and Page Mill. I wanted to go to that division, so I transferred out ofthis project management group down to the—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why did you want to go?Myers: The computer. Computers are important. I’d used the computer a lot, andcomputers were pretty new. When I was at Dartmouth in engineering, therewas one computer on campus, an IBM 1410. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was that one of the huge monsters?Myers: Yes, big as a couch. It was a small computer for the day, and you put punchcards into it. I did a lot of my engineering projects on that computer, so I knewa lot about computers and believed in computers. So when that division wasstarted, I said, “I want to go down there.” So I went down as themanufacturing manager. Actually it was called manufacturing tests. Theywere just starting to build the first computers, HP computers, which were bigrefrigerator-size things. So our group would meet the Fairchild[Semiconductor] truck at the door and get the chips and load them on theboards and do the testing. I had a test group of about ten people working forme.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you have the feeling then that you were on a frontier?Myers: Yes, yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That this was the beginning of a big thing?Myers: Yes. I didn’t know how big, but absolutely. I wanted to be there. JackMelchor, who was running that division at the time, had a heart attack, andTom Perkins, who was the marketing person, took over as the divisionmanager. And he ran that division I don’t know how long, but five or six yearsat least and built it up to $50 to $100 million. We’ll come back to that, but outof that division, a whole tree of people went into the Valley as entrepreneursand venture capitalists. There’s a whole semiconductor tree that people puttogether out of Fairchild. But then there’s another one coming out of HewlettPackard of people, all over the Valley, that came out of that computer group atthat time.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I’ve read about the Fairchild tree—historians love that. But I hadn’t heardmuch about the Hewlett-Packard tree. In the industry, it’s well known?Myers: I don’t know. I’m not sure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You should write a paper! [chuckling]Myers: You can write a paper! [laughter] Anyway, the Fairchild guys were obviouslycomputer people, but the HP—these were the two computer kind of things outhere and so that’s kind of where it all started. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is IBM in the picture yet?Myers: IBM is already there with big computers, so IBM and Burroughs[Corporation] and Scientific Data [Systems], so there were a bunch of bigcompanies with these big monster machines. But nobody doing these smallercomputers with this kind of technology.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was HP already thinking this is going to be for domestic use? This is going togo into people’s homes?Myers: Well, I don’t know about homes. I think the early computers were very much,I don’t know—sort of business and production oriented. I forgot what theysold for, but they were way too complicated for a home. The home computerdidn’t really come along until Apple’s Steve Jobs thing in the mid-seventies.That’s the first one that the home even thought about. These were bigger.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And we’re still in the late sixties?Myers: These are late sixties. And you fed these things with punch paper tape and itwas a whole different world. Everybody’s watch vastly exceeds the power ofthese computers today. But I was down there in the manufacturing group.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And what exactly were you doing?Myers: Well, we were building—I don’t know, ten or twenty machines a month. Andso there was a manufacturing organization that put them together, and mygroup would test them. Testing was actually a fairly elaborate process.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Each one?Myers: Yes. They had to be tested and heat cycled and all kinds of things which youdon’t even bother with today. We built a big heat cycling thing, and we hadprograms written that would exercise them and make them do all differentstuff to make sure that they worked properly. And so I had, whatever, half adozen people working for me doing this sort of final assembly and testportion. I don’t know what the revenues were, but it was a few million at thevery beginning. And then that division moved down to Cupertino with Perkinsrunning it in a new building. It became the Cupertino division, and that’swhen the computer group really took off, and they brought out a number ofnew models. That’s kind of where it all really took off. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now before Perkins left [to co-found Kleiner & Perkins, you stayed—?Myers: I was there until 1970, so Perkins was still there. I’ve forgotten our size, but Imoved into marketing and sales support. And I enjoyed that, but anyway, Ijust felt like leaving. I thought it was sort of getting big enough—I don’t knowexactly the reasons, but it seemed like a time to leave.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you have any observations to make about Tom Perkins in that particularjob?Myers: He’s a brilliant guy. And he was a fantastic division manager.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: In what way?Myers: I didn’t know. I was sort of twenty levels below him! But he seemed decisive.He had a very good team he put together. He’s got a marketing orientation. Iguess I’ve always admired Tom for his incisiveness and so forth, and venturebusiness.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So some of the characteristics that he later used as a venture capitalist you canlook back and see he was using as a division head?Myers: [noncommittal]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [laughter] I’m pushing you.Myers: You can sort of turn it around. He had an operating background from SpectraPhysics and then with Hewlett-Packard. And so, there’s nothing like runningsomething, hiring people, making decisions, building a company, when hebuilt that division. That is one of the things that made him great in the venturebusiness. He knew operations; he knew how to assess entrepreneurs; he knewhow to help entrepreneurs, how to criticize entrepreneurs in a way that [at] thetime most venture capitalists did not understand. So he brought an operatingexpertise to the venture business that had not been there.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And Eugene Kleiner had that background, too, did he not? Myers: Yes, from the Fairchild side, exactly right. I think that’s been the hallmark ofKleiner Perkins from the very beginning of hiring operating people into theventure business.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And that was new.Myers: Yes, that was new.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Okay, 1970. Were you just getting restless? Were you saying to yourself, I’vedone this long enough?Myers: Yes, I’ve been here for four years, [in the] division for two-and-a-half years,and I was restless. You know, I guess I wasn’t quite clear where my careerwas going. The sales/support thing was interesting, but what next? So I guessI felt sort of uncertain or impatient. So I talked to Bill [William L.] Lowe, whowas the head of placement at Stanford Business School. He’d become a friendover the years; he [has since] passed away. And I just said, “Bill, I’m lookingaround. I don’t know what to do, but if something should come along, let meknow.” It was a very casual sort of thing. I hadn’t told anybody; I was justkind of poking around. And so, a number of months passed, and actually in the meantime Bill Lowetalked to Wally Davis. Tommy [Davis] and Wally started Mayfield in 1969. Iguess I’ll come back to how they started it. They started it in 1969 and theyneeded a computer person. Tommy has an English/law background and Wallyhas an engineering background but from the military side. So they need acomputer person and so they were looking. So Bill Lowe said, “Why don’tyou call Gib Myers?” Wally lost my name. And so another couple of monthswent by and Wally called Bill Lowe and said, “Hey, I haven’t heard fromyou,” or, “I lost the name,” or some such thing, and Bill gave him my nameagain and maybe many others. I guess I learned later, many others. Soanyway, Wally called me and I remember it so clearly, because I was walkingto my apartment in Mountain View, [arms] full of groceries, the phone’sringing, pick it up. Wally Davis has a sort of a distinct gruff, short sound,[imitating Davis], “Hello? This is Wally Davis.” “Okay, hello?” [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you know who he was?Myers: No, no clue. He said, “Bill Lowe gave me your name. We’re looking forsomeone to interview. Do you want to talk to us? We’re in venture capital.”Well, I didn’t know what venture capital was. I’d never heard of venture capital! Okay. You know, I just said, “Okay.” So that’s when I went and hadlunch with Tommy and Wally Davis. They had a very small office in theLadera Shopping Center out on Alpine Road. They had, maybe, a thousandsquare feet. So anyway, [I] went out and had lunch. Let me see, 1970, so Imust have been twenty-eight. And gosh, I’m sort of guessing, but Tommy andWally were twenty years older, so they looked horribly old to me! [chuckling]Mid-forties, like, Oh my God! These two guys talking about venture capital. It seems weird, almost embarrassing to say this, but I didn’t know whatventure capital was. I’d never even heard about it. I know about startingcompanies and all, but in terms of an investment venture process—I mean, noone else was doing it. We’ll come back to that, but in this area, there wasDraper Fisher; Bill Edwards, that group—Bryan and Edwards, a couple ofgroups, but that was it. So anyway, I had lunch with them two or three times. I liked them both a lot. Iunderstood as they described what they were doing, but I hadn’t heard of it. Ididn’t have a network to seek out who they were. And maybe I’ll come backto that too. Davis and Rock was the most successful venture fund ever inhistory, and I think it took a few million dollars and made it a hundred millionin the 1960s in a very short length—eight or nine years. So it was a hugesuccess. But I didn’t know anybody that knew him.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now were Davis and Rock calling what they were doing venture capital?Myers: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So some people knew the term.Myers: Yes. The Davis and Rock partnership. Exactly right. So anyway, as I say, forreasons that sort of dumbfound me, I said, “Okay. I’d love to do this.” In fact,I remember at one point asking them—this sounds so silly— Because theyseemed so old to me, I said, I don’t know what my words were exactly, but,“Are you guys really serious about this? Or is this kind of a gentleman’shobby? Are you really serious about it? I mean, this is my career!” [laughter]“Are you trying to build a business here, or not?” Of course, they were, but itwas one of these things when you’re so naïve, and you don’t know someone’sreputation, you can ask questions that you normally would never ask or havethe guts to ask. So anyway, I joined.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What do you think they saw in you, other than here’s somebody who seems toknow about computers? You probably were not the only person they’d takento lunch. Myers: I later learned that there was a long list of applicants who really wanted thejob! I barely wanted the job, like “Okay, I guess I’ll do it.” [chuckling] I don’tknow. It’s hard to say. I assume others had some engineering or computerbackground. Tommy Davis’s philosophy was 120 percent on your chemistrywith the people. That was his thing. Many people say that, but Tommy wasjust a wonderful, congenial individual that related well to people but then alsowas a great assessor of people. He had confidence in that. Wally was less thatway, more of an engineer. But anyway, we got along really well. Maybe itwas my naïve questions, or some such thing. [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you think they checked you out?Myers: I don’t know; I never heard.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So now what happens? You’re hired.Myers: Yes, I’m hired.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Are you even clear what you’re expected to do?Myers: Not very clear. Well, they were getting business plans. So first of all there’sthis tiny little office. It’s a room with a secretary. You walk in the door, thesecretary is straight across. My desk was right by the door, right in front of thesecretary. Tommy and Wally each had a closed-door office to the side. Sothere we were. It’s like, “Here are some business plans people have sent in.Why don’t you go visit these people and see what you think?” “Okay.”[chuckling]. And one of my friends, a roommate, had joined Wells Fargo in the venturecapital business. And so I called him and I said, “Well, I’ve got this job, butwhat do you do?” Things like—“How do you do the capitalized value of acompany.” When I was in business school a lot of these things you kind ofhear, but what does it really mean? So anyway, I went back to Dan Tompkinsand said I would—so I just sort of bumbled along. But it was also a differentkind of business then. I mean, if you made two or three investment per year,that was a big year. Not a big year, a normal year. Not like today, you makeone a month or two a month. Some years we’d make one or zero. It was awhole different style of investing. So it was a much slower pace. Obviously, itgave me the ability to get my feet on the ground.Tommy and Wally were both very supportive. We just got along famouslyfrom the very beginning. I was living in San Francisco and commuting down, but both of them lived in Woodside and Atherton. But after a month or so Igot invited to their house for dinner and we became friends. I’d spend thenight at Wally’s house and do stuff like that, so we became better and betterfriends in the whole process.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you remember the companies that you were sent out to vet when you firstarrived?Myers: Oh I guess sort of vaguely. I actually have a list. I could go down them. One[is] Storage Technology [Corporation], which was a tape drive company inBoulder. So that’s one I related to well. I was the young kid. They made theinvestment decision, but I went along, and I was the one to go back and visitand meet with them a number of times. Alza Pharmaceuticals was aninvestment. I really wasn’t involved in that, but that was very successful, withAlex [Alejandro] Zaffaroni—that was when they first started.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Presumably you were going to look at the firms, make some kind ofassessment and then report back to the two Davises. But what sorts of thingswere you looking at and bringing back to them? By then had you picked upwhat were the important things to be watching for?Myers: No. Who knows! [chuckling] It was sort of a learning process. The basics of:Is there a market for this thing? Is this an entrepreneur that can do something,that can build something? I had a brief operating background at HewlettPackard, but that really was helpful in trying to make assessments—is this justan inventor with an idea? Now where do we go with it? And that was also a time where you didn’t build companies as much as they’rebeing built today or in the eighties and nineties. If there was somebody therethat maybe had a good idea but needed marketing strength, or maybe it was anengineer but [he] needed more management, you might say, “Hey, look, welike you, you have a great idea, but you need this [prospective company] tohave a full team. Go out and find that person and come back to us.” Today it’sdifferent. You kind of glue things together and hope it sticks. But back then itwas like, Let’s keep in touch. (It wasn’t a competitive environment.) “Youneed to find a really good manager. If we have an idea, we’ll tell you, butanyway, go find somebody.”<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: They were calling their operation the Mayfield Fund?Myers: That was Mayfield Fund, right. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why not Davis and Davis?Myers: Well, yes, let me give you some background to that. After Davis and Rock,Tommy kind of semi-retired, went to work for Blythe and Company, abrokerage firm at that time. He and Wally weren’t related and hadn’t knowneach other. I [don’t] quite remember how they met, but they met through acommon bond at Stanford, a Stanford connection. And they both had the ideathat Silicon Valley is going to be really important. Stanford’s endowmentought to be part of Silicon Valley. And so they started Mayfield on thepremise that we’ll get Stanford’s endowment money to be the fund, becauseStanford’s just got to be part of what’s happening. That’s why we’re going todo this. And so as they got that going. They also put together a Stanfordscientific advisory board. So there were about six or eight Stanford professorswho were advisors.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Representing different disciplines?Myers: Yes, chemistry, electronics—different disciplines over there. First the[Stanford] endowment said, “No, this is silly. This isn’t a good use of ourfunds.”<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was it perhaps also that universities are ivory towers, and we don’t deal withthese business folk?Myers: Well, no. Stanford, I think, has always been unusual.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, it has been.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [Frederick E.] Terman.Myers: Dean Terman had always felt that there should be collaboration between theuniversity and the corporate business world. So that goes way back as Imentioned before we started taping, Tommy worked with Dean Terman in thefifties and the companies that were started out of Stanford. So the issue reallywas just the endowment. Endowment funds didn’t give money. HorsleyBridge gave us money—or Horsley Keogh—in the late seventies, and it reallydidn’t catch on until the mid-eighties as the thing to do. So this was the latesixties. This is a foolish way to use your endowment funds [Stanfordbelieved]. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why did it take so long? Why didn’t universities get it?Myers: Because they didn’t relate that to Silicon Valley. It was just a financialmanagement job. It should be invested conservatively and probably wasinvested mostly in bonds, which was the conservative strategy way back then.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So it was the risk that scared them.Myers: Yes, they didn’t want to take the risk. And venture capital, you know, alwayshas been considered a high-risk business in spite of its success. And so itpercent of our endowment and give it to venture capital, and it’s part of abalanced portfolio.” But those concepts didn’t exist then at all.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see.Myers: So anyway, the endowment said no. So Tommy and Wally said, “Well, westill think this is important.” So they went out to raise money, and the firstfund was, I think, $3.5 million, which of course is nothing compared to today.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And that was just going to private investors?Myers: Yes, to private, well, Blythe and Company was an investor, and someinsurance company was, and then a bunch of individuals. But what they didwhich was so unusual: they agreed [that]15% of the profits you get as alimited partner you have to give to Stanford as a donation. So their core themehere was: Let’s support Stanford. Stanford’s got to be part of Silicon Valley.That’s why we’re doing this fund. So they didn’t get the endowment money,but the rest of you guys, you’ve got to make a contribution to Stanford.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was their thinking, well, the university is where the knowledge base islocated? We’re going to profit from that intellectually and also maybefinancially by building companies around this knowledge?Myers: Well, no, it wasn’t quite that sophisticated back then. I think they just believedsome might come from Stanford, but we didn’t spend a lot of time miningStanford for stuff. That’s being done today but not back then.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So it was more just an investment. Myers: Well, Silicon Valley is going to be a big deal. One way or the other, whereverit comes from. And Stanford’s right here in Silicon Valley. They’ve got to bepart of it. So even if the endowment won’t help us, we’ll give money back toStanford in the process.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was it obvious that Silicon Valley was going to be a big deal?Myers: I don’t think so. It was mostly apple orchards and there was no 280 and all therest. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So they were just perceptive? They saw where this whole region was going togo?Myers: Well, I think so, but I actually hand a lot to Tommy. Tommy in the fifties[was] with Kern County Land Company. He came out here and worked withDean Terman, and that’s where Tommy’s eyes were opened up and theystarted two companies out of Stanford that say, wow, there’s technology, andwhat you can do with developing companies around it is going to be reallyimportant. So I think he got his eye-opening then. Then Davis and Rockinvested in—I don’t know how many companies, ten or fifteen. But their bighit was Scientific Data Systems, a computer company in L.A. So he’d beenexposed to what could happen. Scientific Data Systems was sold to Xerox fora billion dollars in the mid-sixties. A billion dollars is unheard of! A hugenumber! So, Tommy was pretty savvy at that point [about] what washappening. Wally had more of an operating background but had been around.So that was very much their inclination.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What happens next then? They got the Stanford money—Myers: Oh no, they didn’t get the Stanford money, but they raised outside funds.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh right, yes, I’m sorry.Myers: And gave 15 percent to Stanford. It was a little $3.5 million fund with aStanford advisory board still involved. So anyway, we proceeded off. It was apretty unsuccessful fund. [chuckling] We ran into the ’72 depression—actually, ’72-’73 things were really bad. I printed out some lists ofinvestments and we could talk about a few of them. But the fund really wasn’tvery successful, but it was a $3.5 million fund and people sort of made acouple of percent kind of thing, but for the times it was okay. Nobody was toounhappy. It was in ’72 or ’73 we started to raise Mayfield II, which was going to be a$7.5 million fund. And that was in the midst of the market downturn. Iremember this because Tommy—Tommy was our chief fundraiser—spent ayear looking for money, and he could not raise— He went to insurancecompanies in all these small towns and all around and he was having a heck ofa time raising the $7.5 million.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were you getting worried?Myers: I don’t know. It didn’t matter to me. I was young, whatever happened kind ofthing.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You didn’t have a family to support?Myers: Yes—I got married in ’76. So Tommy finally met Phil Horsley with theUniversity of Rochester. There was Phil Horsley and Kevin Keogh, the twoinvestment officers, and they’re the ones that said that they would giveMayfield II, the second fund, money.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now who are they?Myers: They were endowment managers at the University of Rochester. They mightbe the first endowment managers, ever, to invest in venture capital. Someonecould check that out, but real close. They’re wonderful people; they hit it offwith Tommy. We all flew back; we all spent a lot of time with them. And Ithink they gave us—I’d have to look, I don’t remember—just half the fund, ora big amount. And then with that we got some money from the FordFoundation and some others, and the whole fund came together. But it wasreally the Phil Horsley/Kevin Keogh [fund]. They later left and started theHorsley Bridge firm in San Francisco which is a $20 billion fund of funds. Sothey’ve been enormously successful on their own, and they’ve also been acontinuous investor in all the Mayfield funds through all those years. So therelationship goes way back.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So you really started something back then.Myers: Yes, absolutely right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now was $7 million— Myers: Seven and a half million was the size—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Seven and a half—was that a respectable fund?Myers: That was a pretty big fund. There was somebody in Chicago, I can’tremember, who maybe had a $10 million fund—which seemed awfully large.And Reid Dennis was starting IVP [Institutional Venture Partners] rightaround that time. He had $7 to $10 [million]. Kleiner Perkins I don’t think hadquite started. This is ’73-’74. But anyway, that was considered a prettyrespectable size fund.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And Pitch Johnson was around.Myers: Was Pitch on his own then? I didn’t know him then. There was Sutter Hill,because shortly thereafter Dave [David L.] Anderson joined Sutter Hill astheir young person kind of thing.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And so does Bill Draper.Myers: And Bill, of course, was there, and Paul [A.] Wythes, I’m sure. That was atime when, as I said, you would make two or three investments per year.You’d invest $100,000, $200,000, $300,000. You’d do tons of due diligence.My main thing was just checking out the management. I’d spend daysresearching a CEO. I talked to everybody he’d worked with—and for him,above him—mountains of information! We just did tons of homework. AndI’m not sure it was all valuable or not. Today we wouldn’t do that. But it wasa time—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How did you do that? By picking up the phone?Myers: Yes, right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why did you do that much due diligence?Myers: It was just a slower pace.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So you had the time. Myers: You had the time, and the philosophy then was very much management,management, management. And it’s shifted some. But back then it was totallythat. So you spent almost all your time on the management pieces and gettingto know them and spending time with them and all that kind of thing—really,really a big [deal]. It’s still a big deal, but what would sort of come later hasnow been balanced by markets and all kinds of other factors that go intomaking a successful company. Back then those things weren’t emphasized inthe way they are today.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How much were you yourself going on the facts as opposed to your intuition,your reading of the people that you were considering investing in?Myers: Well, you can’t avoid your intuition. It’s always there.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But some people weight it more heavily than others in making a decision.Myers: I think we were very much a firm that weighted our intuition heavily, and thenwe’d do a lot of homework. Was there a fly in the ointment here? Was there aproblem—some things we didn’t know about? Because obviously intuitiondoesn’t tell you everything.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I read that Mayfield tried to move—I guess it would be the twoDavises—towards a less intuitive, more process-oriented way of going aboutbusiness, by at least having meetings. You said that Tommy Davis made a lotof his decisions on the base of his reading of people, on the basis of intuition.Myers: Oh, yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you think there might be a harder core way of going about it?Myers: Well, yes, it’s sort of an evolution. Tommy was, just what you say, veryintuitive and would just like someone, some situation, and want to do it. Wallywas more of the engineer, and like, “I don’t believe that. I don’t like that.”And I was kind of the in-between person, the younger one. And so as theyears went on and we added a few more partners— Glenn [M.] Mueller wasan important new addition, and he had a consulting, strong businessbackground. So as the young people sort of gained strength, we began to put in moreprocess like, “Let’s have a partners meeting to talk about these things.”[laughter] There was none of that [before]. You’d walk in the office, let’s do this, let’s do that, okay fine kind of thing. And I was the young person, so Icould be ignored or listened to when they wanted to. But then we come intothe late seventies—I guess they had a bit more confidence in me, we addedmore people, and then we began to do a little more of this process stuff. Ithink intuition continues to be important, but you’ve got to back it up. That’snot sufficient.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Would you say that today Mayfield perhaps leans more towards the intuitiveside than other venture capital firms?Myers: I can’t—you know, I’ve been out of Mayfield for ten years. And Mayfieldstruggled badly. The 2000 fund, the 2001 funds—everybody’s funds werebad. Mayfield’s were really bad. And so Mayfield stumbled. I think they’vepicked it up now; they just finished raising some money; they’ve changed abunch of partners. But they’ve gone through some tough times, and I thinkthey’re coming back real strong.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: As a spin-off from the bubble?Myers: Let me see—I left Mayfield in ’98 and started the Entrepreneurs Foundationand just zoomed out doing that. I think we had some management issues; wehad some hiring problems in part because that was a time when everybodywas growing, hiring lots of people. So some of the people brought in weren’tthe right people. Everybody was running a hundred miles an hour, so I thinkMayfield kind of lost their way for a couple of years there. I’ve heardcriticism and concerns and all that sort of thing. I think they’ve got it backnow. They have addressed some of the management issues and hired somedifferent people, and I think they’ve got a really good team. It’s hard for me tosay what it’s like now. I would say more in general though, Mayfield was characterized [as] a firmthat the entrepreneurs liked to work with. We were always on their side. Theynever had to look over their shoulder that they’d get knifed in the back ortaken advantage of. We were very fair, and we were good people to workwith. I think then, and this is eighties and nineties, we weren’t as good asSequoia [Capital] in marketing. I mean Don [Donald T.] Valentine’s amarketing genius. His imprimatur was: Let’s get a huge, fast-growing marketthat’ll make up for a lot of sins. We’ll also think about management and otherthings, but fast-growing market was his mantra, which was very good. Andthen Kleiner Perkins was here with a strong operating thing, and so theywould operate or they had the insights to operate.I don’t think Mayfield—we had some of these characteristics. We hiredYogen Dalal and some operating people and so forth. Mayfield was much 20more a great firm to work with. Everybody liked us: we want Mayfield part ofthe deal. But then they’d get some other kind of expertise from a KleinerPerkins or a Sequoia that we weren’t giving them. So maybe that’s one way. But just to go back to one piece in the mid-seventies, which I alwaysremember well in this smaller business: every month the venture industry ofthe Bay Area would get together for lunch at Nob Hill, at the Fairmont. Therewere only twenty in the room, and it was a very different time because it wasopen. Everybody talked about what they were looking at, what their opinionswere. If you weren’t looking at it, they’d say, “Well, you can look at it. Comeon, come on.” There was no competition. Everybody was sharing, workingtogether, and actually, much to the detriment of the entrepreneurs, we wereworking together like, “Okay, we’ll offer them a buck a share. I’m sure they’lltake it. There’s nobody else around,” kind of thing. But in complete contrastto where we are now in the nineties, where it’s so highly competitive, and soforth. That was just the antithesis. It was very much a gentleman’s business.That’s what it evolved from.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And what is that a function of? Expansion? You’re now no longer an intimatelittle club? You’re a huge industry.Myers: It’s money. It’s tons of money that’s come into the business, a huge amount ofsuccess, and then the general growth of the business. You could sort of saythat almost any business when it becomes successful and gets surfeited withmoney, it becomes more competitive. And now it’s become ruthlesslycompetitive. For at least fifteen years [venture capitalists have] had vastlymore money to invest than they knew what to do with. The downturns havenever shrunk the pool of money available much, in fact, frankly, at all. Sothere’s always been far too much money available, and it makes it now, andhas since the mid-nineties, so competitive, because we’ve all got too muchmoney. We’ve got to get the deal; we’ve got to control the deal; we don’twant to share it. On and on.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Another thing I read is that, at least in the early days, Mayfield focused onearly stage investment. What was the rationale there? And was it ever aserious consideration to do later stage investing?Myers: It’s always been early stage. Later stage investing wasn’t a term, you know.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] I wondered if it was.Myers: It wasn’t segmented. It becomes sort of semantics. Early stage back thenwould be the first dollars, but you had more of a team. There was more around it. There was the expectation that the team would have left their [former]company, would have worked in their garage, would have built a prototype ontheir own. More would have happened on their own. And so now we’re ready,which would almost be today’s second-stage investment. That was justexpected then. So we were all kind of in this same realm of investment, and acompany would need another round or two of capital and the same groupwould put that money up. Maybe someone new came in, but you didn’tdistinguish among stages. There weren’t that many players and there weren’tthe different funds that thought about it that way. That didn’t come in till theeighties, I don’t think.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Mayfield would pull in other VCs and investors?Myers: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It wasn’t doing this all on its own.Myers: Oh no, not at all. No one would think of it. I don’t think anybody did it bythemselves. Everybody worked together.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It was too much of a risk and you probably didn’t have the capital.million, and there’d be four or five groups in it. There’d be a lead investor,somebody on the board.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did Mayfield worry about whether it was a lead investor or not?Myers: No, it just wasn’t part of the lexicon.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was this part of the old-boys’ network?Myers: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: If you had a deal, you would call up Joe Blow at another firm. Was that theway it was done?Myers: Yes, share it, put it together. Exactly. Remember, it was Bill Edwards, thiswhole group—part of it was what people were doing. Back then, if you were on four or five boards, it was considered—five boards was heresy! You can’tpossibly do a good job and be on five boards. That’s crazy! I remember BillEdwards being on five boards. People just thought: What’s wrong with him?Of course, today, you can be on ten or twelve boards and get by.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And that is impossible, isn’t it? Can you be doing a good job on ten boards?Myers: Well, maybe not, but everybody’s doing it. That’s hard to say. So BillEdwards might be on a bunch of boards. He’d have a new deal that maybehe’d found, so he’d call Mayfield or Sutter Hill or somebody and say, “Look,I can’t do it, go on the board—I’ve got too much to do, but why don’t we alldo this one if you pick up this.” It was very much of a sharing, let’s worktogether, you do this one, I’ll work on this one kind of thing. There wasrelatively little, almost no competition.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, aside you wanting to spend more time on the Entrepreneurs Foundation,did you leave Mayfield because you see that venture capital is becoming adifferent thing and you’re not as anxious to be part of it for all those reasonsthat you’re talking about?Myers: No, hmm. Maybe a little. At that point it had been twenty-eight years, and Iwas tired. My role had been managing partner since the mid-eighties. Tommywas ill and inactive in ’83 or ’84. Wally left in around ’86, and sofrom ’84, ’85, I was the managing partner. I spent a lot of my time onmanaging and growing people and hiring people and building the firm, and Ifeel that was one of my contributions. And I was also on boards and did that. Ifrankly feel my legacy is almost more with the quality of the firm that we builtup until I left. So anyway, I was tired and it’s just one of these things whereyou go to work at 8 or 9:00 and you go in a meeting and you fall asleep rightaway, like, why am I falling asleep? [chuckling] Another business plan! Thesame old routine I’ve heard a thousand times. I’m tired of this. And there’s somuch to do in the world. So many different opportunities. I’ve always felt thatthere’s just a hundred things to do. And so I was tired and I felt, okay, time toleave. I didn’t expect to leave quite as quickly. That sort of gets to theEntrepreneurs Foundation story. I thought I’d have the usual two- or threeyear transition and all that, and then I just dove in to get this thing going.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, we’ll definitely talk about that.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You’ve mentioned in passing the tough years of the early seventies, what theexternal economy is doing [that is] is going to shape how things are going for you. It’s those contextual things that tend to fall out of the stories people tell.One of the reasons that I try to throw rather a broad net is that you can’tanticipate accurately what will interest future historians, sociologists, whoeveris looking at this oral histories!Myers: [chuckling] That’s very interesting, yes, right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So it’s great what you’re doing. [brief interruption for microphoneadjustments]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You mentioned in passing building companies. Am I right in thinking thatthat’s a big part of what Mayfield is trying to do? It’s not just a matter offinding the money and investing it, it’s building a company to be productive.Talk about that part of the process, please.Myers: I think that evolved in the seventies. It was a little more of a passiveinvestor—on the board but not as proactive—as we evolved. In the seventies,Glenn Mueller, Grant Heidrich, our team sort of evolved and we becamemuch more active about how to help a company, which is kind of very muchthe theme. But back then, that was somewhat new—all the things you mightdo as a venture capitalist, whether on a board or not, to build a company. One huge thing is hiring people. And so, actually, I hired a guy named Bill[William D.] Unger in the mid-eighties who had a search background. Mythought was maybe a search guy can not only assess people better, but he hasa search process, he has a search network, so he can speed up the process ofgetting people into these companies. The faster we get good people in, thebetter. Bill was a good guy, he has been with Mayfield until I left or beyond.But the point was to look for a variety of ways where you can get the bestpeople in there quickly. And then whatever else you can do—like a DonValentine had marketing expertise, and he’d bring that to bear, and we didn’thave much of that operating expertise. We had some, but I think if anything, itwas how you get good people in the company as fast as possible. So actually,I was saying it was a very proactive process, and as we went on, we spentmore and more time on it. It was obviously an important part.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: When you were looking for new people, were you looking for a person to filla particular niche?Myers: Yes. You fired a CEO and you’ve got to replace him with somebody. Butmore often the team, the company is growing, and you need a new marketingperson or sales or a new executive in the team. Often the existing executives are so busy a) they don’t maybe recognize it quickly enough, they don’t wantto take the time to work on it—kind of like it’s hard to get to these things. So Ithink one of the things that we were good as was to flag this early, get theirattention on it. For many years, that’s where if I was on the board I’d bringBill Unger in, and Bill was really good at talking about: How do we get a newperson in here? What are the characteristics? How do you define what youwant; what [are] the must-haves, like-to-haves. All that. And then we’d helpthem find search firms; we’d help them direct the search firm. So we werevery proactive; we’d interview most of the candidates. It was a really veryactive process of getting people in.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You’re putting it in the past.Myers: Well, only because I’m past. [chuckling] Actually, I don’t even know todaywhat [Mayfield does]. I presume there’s some of that, but the investment paceis so high, like at least one a month, maybe two a month, that, for all theventure firms, you just don’t have time for any of that. And there’s alsoarguments today—pretty much I’m just out of touch—that the funds havegotten bigger. Well, they got real big, the bubble, up to a billion dollars andnow they’re back to $300 or $400 million. But see, if you’re putting $300 to$400 million to work in four or five years, [it] is very difficult. You’re so busyputting that money to work, and finding the next new investment, and thenbeing on some boards that the proactive process I just talked about was muchmore of the eighties and early-nineties. We’d make five investments per year,and we’d have a team of six or eight people, so we could do that. I’m not surehow much that’s done today.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You make it sound as though it’d be very difficult to give that kind ofattention.Myers: Well, yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were you starting to say something?Myers: Well, what’s evolved also is a group of seed investors—there’s another wordfor them. It’s individuals that have made money; I’ll think of it in a second.And so there is now another subgroup, usually not as well organized, thatsometimes does this seed round investments.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Angels? Myers: That’s it—angel investors that do some of the really early-stage stuff that I’mnot sure how many venture funds do these days.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Would the tendency be for Mayfield to work intensely with a company untilthe IPO? Or only dip in when there seemed to be a need?Myers: Well, you know, you kind of prioritize. If things are going well, you don’thave to work quite so hard. And then when you get to the IPO, if it’s a goodcompany, often then— In the eighties and nineties, the strategy would be, ifit’s a good company, you want to stay on that board at least for a few years.Well, first of all, we still held stock in it, so if you think you can be helpful—But it also added to the [company’s] reputation. So as the business got more competitive, and it swung more from aroundwhere the entrepreneurs had the upper competitive advantage, theentrepreneurs would say, now what kind of venture fund do I want? Thenthey’d look at you and say, “Well, you were on the board of so-and-somicrowave or a fiber optic company. You must know a lot about that. I wantto work with that person at Mayfield,” or at Kleiner, whatever it was. So in the mid- and toward the end of the nineties, the entrepreneurs very muchcalled the shots. We were, everybody was running around trying to puffthemselves up and make the venture capitalists look attractive to theentrepreneurs. We didn’t have to bother with all of that in the eighties, luckily.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How important did you feel it was to be familiar with the basic technology ofa company? Did that factor in?Myers: I think it’s essential. You’ve got to understand their business. So I think that’sabsolutely essential.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Does that explain why a Tommy Davis—I forget what his background was.Myers: He was an English major and law, and then he did the oil exploration and allthat.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I shouldn’t make it an either/or, because I’m sure a lot of it was hispersonality. But if he didn’t have a strong technical background, wouldn’t hehave been thrown into a more intuitive way of going about this? In contrast toyou with your engineering and your HP experience. Myers: Absolutely. Aside from his phenomenal personality, Tommy wouldn’t havebeen very competitive in the mid-nineties. That’s when your marketing andtechnology, or business, or whatever—all the venture capitalists were trying tohone up, like a bird putting their feathers up: here’s what we have here; here’swhat our firm has; here’s the expertise of our firm, so we could attract theentrepreneurs. And Tommy would have had a harder time with all that, that’sfor sure.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: The information about your wanting to have more of a process came from TheNew Venturers: [Inside the High-Stakes World of Venture Capital], which is abook by John [W.] Wilson.Myers: I don’t know if I’ve looked at it or not.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I wondered if you could pick out, once there was more of a process atMayfield, a prototype meeting in which the partners got together anddiscussed the possibility of an investment. Please give me a picture of how thediscussion might go.Myers: [chuckling] I don’t know. It was never that formalized. Well, we’d have aweekly partners’ meeting. It used to be all morning on Monday, andeventually it became all day on Monday. We’d have a lead partner, and we’dalways have a second partner that was working with them. There’s always ahopper full of stuff. So you’ve got four or five things that you consider hotand important that people are actually working on. So the lead partner wouldreport on those particular deals they’re working on, what had come up, whatwere the issues. Others in the partnership would chime in and raise theirquestions and review prior questions that had been raised. And so that would be a process that, until things got feverishly competitive, atleast in the late eighties and nineties where we’d go on for a number of weeks.And if someone wasn’t happy, was concerned, not happy, they might join theteam. And so, we kept track of who was on a team and who was doing whatand working on what deals. That was part of the organization of the wholeprocess. But out of that, we’d begin to peel off what the issues are with agiven company and where we kind of [were] working through them. I don’tknow. Something like that. It’s hard to say it’s so structured, but it was verymuch of a process, and we had little charts and keeping track of who’sworking on who and what was going on.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I read that you’ve been involved in something like 300 deals. Myers: No. Me? I don’t know. That many? Could be. I don’t know how many.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I found three articles on the Entrepreneurs Foundation, and that’s where I sawthat statistic.[laughter]Myers: Beats me!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You don’t keep track, obviously.Myers: I think Mayfield made over 500 investments over its lifetime, but that’s just agross number—it doesn’t mean much. It’s a marketing number. [laughing]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Even if it’s half of that, it’s an impressive number. Did you have a role thatwas distinct from the other partners?Myers: Well, I was very much the managing partner. People have differentpersonalities. You get to know each other. One person may be kind of sloppyon their homework or gets real excited about something, so you’ve got to dothe balancing with every person, sort of get the right information, make surethe rest of the partnership’s coming along. So a big part of my role waskeeping that balance, so the stronger partner, maybe more senior, moreforceful, more outspoken, didn’t overwhelm the process and not have otherpeople speak up or get their input. And vice versa for someone who wasn’t asstrong but maybe had good ideas. And so I spent a fair amount of timedrawing out or balancing—“Last week you said this. Have you had thatresolved?” kind of thing. But then I also spoke up for myself, and just by dint of time, age, or whatever—somehow for some reason [people] listen to you more when you get older.It probably isn’t appropriate, but it seems to work that way! [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, you probably had a track record that they recognized.Myers: I don’t know. There are times in a meeting where you just say, “Come onguys. This doesn’t make any sense. Why are you kidding yourself? This isfundamentally wrong. What are you thinking about?” And luckily, I think wehad unusually good partner dynamics. In fact, I’ll come back to that—so thatno partner would dominate, and I didn’t dominate. But some would push backand say, “Gib, I don’t care what you think. This is it. I’ll do some more work.”Or, “I’ll prove it to you.” And so I think one of the strengths we had is howthe group would work together.  In fact, we so liked each other—there was a period of fifteen years when if wewere having a party, we’d say, “Let’s invite the Mayfield partners. Who elseshould we invite?” We were just the best of friends and the wives were best offriends. It was just a wonderful, cohesive group. Not everybody was as strongas others, and some people were performing much better than others. But—we’re all on one team, let’s work together and not worry about one personhaving substantially more good deals than somebody else.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you suspect that that’s unusual?Myers: Very unusual. Now that fell apart after a while. Appropriately—I don’t knowappropriately or not. After a while you sort of say, “Let’s start to keep track ofthings.” And we hadn’t tracked carefully how many good deals a, or b, or cperson brought to us, or evolved into all these characteristics: what theybrought in, what they supported, what boards they were on. But anyway, thereare lots of ways you can track these. We started tracking, and it all becamemore divisive. [chuckling] Well, wait a minute, so and so has had half thegood deals in this partnership—shouldn’t they have more ownership?Shouldn’t they be paid more? And this person hasn’t done a thing for the lasttwo years! They shouldn’t be paid as much. I don’t know how you avoid that,but that was the beginning of the end. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What era was that happening in?Myers: Oh, starting in the mid-nineties. I don’t know.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Are you painting a picture of Mayfield when it was working well as still beingsomewhat the exception to the rule?Myers: Oh, I think so. Those were times when our arch competitors were Sequoia andKleiner Perkins. They were very competitive within each partnership; theydidn’t like working with each other; partner meetings were very rough andtumble—a whole different atmosphere. It’s hard to say that was any better orworse. We had a certain style that we really liked and worked well for us.They obviously did really well themselves in that time. But I think theMayfield partners would not have fit into those partnerships.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: No, it doesn’t sound that way.Myers: So we kind of made it work with what we had. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: On the Mayfield Website, which maybe has changed in the ten years [Myerslaughs] so it may not apply, but I quote, “We view ourselves as theentrepreneur’s partners.”Myers: Yep, that goes back. They kept that. I’ll be darned. That’s very much how wefelt. Entrepreneurs would say that they first and foremost really liked workingwith us, and these other firms they didn’t trust or they would get a knife in theback or something would happen. They couldn’t trust them. Now, those otherfirms also brought things that they liked, so it balances, but this was ourhallmark. I guess it maybe still is. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And was some of this confidence just about money? I mean by that, if youinvested in a firm, was there some kind of understanding, unless things wentterribly wrong, that you would be there for x number of years?Myers: Oh absolutely. That was expected of everybody. You wouldn’t be a goodventure firm, because in any given round, others have come in, so maybeyou’re the lead and you’ve just raised a bunch of money, maybe one moreperson joins the board, but you’re kind of representing a bigger group thanjust yourself.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see.Myers: And so if you don’t do your job, you won’t be asked next time. You won’t beas attractive to work with, because you don’t follow through, you don’tsupport the deal. On the other hand, from the entrepreneur’s point [of view],sometimes though, the venture capitalists were always gunning for them orquick on the trigger. The personal dynamics between the board member andthe entrepreneurial team—that’s where we kind of won the game, because wealways had good dynamics. They liked to work with us; they’d haveconfidence in us; we’d have dinner with them. We’d do lots of things in apartner relationship, and other firms didn’t have that kind of relationship.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You’re painting a vivid picture of a friendly relationship. Is there also anemotional component to this? Meaning do these companies become to youmore than just an investment?Myers: Yes, sure. It sort of varies with the kind of relationship, but particularly, asyou get to know a management and you work with them. First you’ve got aperformance pressure. You do feel the pressure of your company’s doing well.Sure, yes, absolutely. Not all. Some. But absolutely true, yes. 30<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And what about—I imagine that one of the crises in this trajectory of a youngcompany is when there has to be a management change. Does that represent acrisis for you too? To have to tell somebody, “Okay. You’re out.”Myers: Well, I don’t know. I guess I haven’t felt that. A)You always wait too long, sothat by the time you’re having the sit-down talk, you know you should havedone it six months ago. But then six months ago you couldn’t have done it.The other employees in the company are coming by your home at night andsaying, “You know, I’ve got to talk to you about this person. This is just notworking. We’re about to leave. The company is going to coll[apse]—you’vegot to fix this.” So I go, “Okay.” [chuckling] So—you know—wake up!We’ve gone through the process so many times. It’s just that it always seemsto get to that point. So by the time that happens, you know you’ve got to do something. It’s in thebest interests of the company, and it’s in the best interests of that person,because that person’s going to fail horribly, or they’re going to swallow hardand get it over with now, and let’s move on with things. We felt we had, inmost cases, very good personal relationships with management. And so, itwasn’t easy, but they would trust us in not saying we’re trying to pull a fastone or, “Oh, you never liked me anyway. I knew you were always againstme.” We didn’t have that kind of thing, so we’d engineer the process. But thatengineering was quite complicated. You often had to get other board membersto go along. Some of the management team had already taken sides, and soyou’d meet with this group or that group. It was often a very laborious processof engineering a CEO change, even later, when there was a problem.Anyway—that was a big part of it. A lot of time.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What about social impact or lack thereof of a company? Does that enter intothe mix of things you consider?Myers: No. [chuckling] I tried to change it for ten years, and I almost—it’s acomplicated question. It’s like raising children: if you raise them with theright values, the community and a sense of value by the community can fit ineven at the early stages. You might not do much, but you set the seeds. I couldelaborate on the EF [Entrepreneurs Foundation] program, but nevertheless, Ifelt that was a culture that does fit with early—I believe firmly it does. Butpeople are so focused on, and working so hard to do, what they’re doing, thatthey can’t squeeze it in very well. So EF has worked with 180 companies, and at least two thirds of them havebeen very successful. They feel it’s added a lot to their culture and made thema better company, and so forth. But I’d really hoped we’d reach kind of atipping point, where every venture capitalist and every lawyer just said, “This is the thing you ought to do. The community is part of where we live. Youwill be a better company, a stronger company, for the community being partof your culture,” even in a small way—it grows later. And I just cannot getwidespread adoption from that community.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because of—Myers: They’re just totally focused on what they’re doing. They’re spending twentyfour hours a day; they’re getting divorced. We don’t want to fit one morething in. So there are some entrepreneurs that do believe that, and we havegreat spokesmen that think it’s the best thing. I mean, everybody works tobuild a culture—they have company meetings, they have beer gatherings, theyhave all kinds of things they do for the culture. So why isn’t some communitystuff, some volunteerism, maybe then a variety of things could be part of thatculture. Some believe it, but I haven’t gotten it to be everybody. So EF,actually, has broadened our strategy. We now work with larger companies,public companies, all kinds of companies, because we’re kind of the preeminent group in terms of how to do community involvement with yourcompany. But we can’t stick just with the early-stage companies, becauseeach one continues to be too hard to fight.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, let’s stop there for this time.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I thought that we’d start this time with some more general questionsabout venture capital, and then end up with your community-related work.Some of these questions will probably sound really basic to you, but I’massuming that eventually this whole interview series will get a wide viewingand not everybody’s going to be up to speed with venture capital. So thequestion is: What are the key things that you look for when an entrepreneurcomes to you?Myers: Hmm. Well, you actually have to parcel it by time frame. It shifted.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: All right. That’s good.Myers: In the seventies and early eighties, particularly the seventies—I think I saidsome of this before—you’d have an entrepreneur or an engineer/inventor typecome, and as a venture capitalist, we all knew we had to have a team to makethis happen. So in those days, you might well tell them to go away and go find a marketing person, or a CEO, or somebody to run it, or whatever the rightcombination was. It was a less competitive world, and I think that’s, frankly, abetter system, where they go out and they struggle, they find the right personto work with, that they can get along with. Then as they had team members, you invested, and you helped them build theteam. But there, in that case, we were looking for highly unique products withonly a few people in the world [who] know how to make them, addressinglarge markets that you can get to. Pretty simple stuff. But that’s where a lot ofthe technology came in. Back then, at that point, you really had theopportunity for doing truly unique things, and there was only a handful ofpeople in the world that would know something about this or that kind oftechnology. Then came the eighties and even more in the nineties as it sort of progressed,or as the business got more and more competitive, you’d work with anentrepreneur at the very beginning that you knew couldn’t run the company,and you’d hopefully have an understanding they were going to bring inmanagement at the right time. And so then your role as a venture capitalist, avery important role, was to begin to help build that management team, whichwas always risky. It doesn’t always work when they don’t like your choice.And so lots of issues come up. But it’s kind of evolved to that. Then [it] evolved even further, where in the nineties, with all the things goingon, is the venture capitalists who were out looking for technology and lookingfor somebody at Stanford or some place that they could back and build thecompany around and then add all the rest of the pieces, which is inherently aneven riskier strategy, but the competitive pressures of the whole businessforced people [to that]. We used to have incubator space here. In fact, half thisfloor that you walked through were small companies. We’d put them in ouroffices and work with them and help them to get going in this kind offormative stage.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And was that a very desirable thing for an aspiring company to do?Myers: Well, for an aspiring company it’s very desirable; it’s a good deal. They canstart early and they get the support systems of Mayfield and everything else.We also had entrepreneurs in residence. We’d have a CEO or someone thatwe liked a lot and we wanted to hold onto him, we’d give them an office, paythem something to do homework, help us do due diligence. So sometimes, notalways but sometimes, that entrepreneurial group would either support theengineering group, those with the ideas and sometimes they’d match up andsome would come across. I can’t think of examples right now. So it was greatfor them.  I think it was inherently a more risky strategy for us, but a number ofcompanies came out of it. The MIPS Computer Systems that I’ve mentioned.This was three people from Stanford—John [L.] Hennessy, the president ofStanford, among them, who had an idea of a new processor design. One of ourpartners, Grant Heidrich, knew John and said, “Why don’t you come to ouroffices. We’ll help you develop it.” It was just kind of like they had proved itin prototype over there. That’s all they’d done. So they came over and spent ayear with us, and then we helped build a management team around it. It was acompany that was successful for us, went public, acquired by—so forth. Andin the biotech field we had a number of those, so it definitely worked. It’s anawful lot more work and lots of them don’t work, but it sort of evolved to that.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: In the MIPS case, it was personal contact, but is that the usual way that abudding company or an entrepreneur with an idea came to Mayfield?Myers: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: He knew somebody at Mayfield or she knew somebody?Myers: Absolutely. Everybody jokes, but we have never funded a company from abusiness plan that was mailed to us.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Never!Myers: No. That would be kind of like—what’s this? It’s all about the people, sounless you get that personal connection started, you don’t get started.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I guess if you don’t open the envelope you will never know, but what ifthere was just a really hot new idea? It would seem that you might be losingout on things.Myers: Well, we opened all the envelopes. We always did. But you know, it’s part ofthe process. Part of how Silicon Valley works is that the person that wants tostart a company, has to find a way. You mail your resume around for a job andyou almost never get a job. It’s some connection that happens. Theentrepreneur needs to find those connections. That’s part of the process. On the other side, as we got more competitive, we made ourselves more andmore visible, easier to find, and so we looked to have press in the papers andtalk about our expertise. We had people at Stanford and Berkeley all over theplace visiting the engineering schools, meeting people, saying, “Here we are. We’re looking for projects. We’re looking for things to do.” And so as I said,it got more competitive. We were out there looking ourselves to make thoseconnections easier and earlier.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Right. I have noticed at Haas [School of Business] the corporate presencethere, the number of quasi-social occasions in which budding businessstudents can meet companies.Myers: Well, we started the Mayfield Fellows Program. And there’s one at Haas now.Both the engineering school and the business school are part of it. And there’sone at Stanford. We put up, I don’t know how much—millions of dollars,quite a bit of money to get these programs going, and then they become aMayfield Fellow. They’re still doing what they’re doing, but they get afellowship award. I don’t check all that happens now. I’m out of date on it, butwe end up with a real presence in the program, and then the fellows come overhere and spend time and this and that. These are great people that we want tohave them know about us, kind of thing.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That’s part of the program? They come to Mayfield to spend a period of time?Myers: Yes. They do some dinners, they might do a half-day conference for fellowsand bring in speakers. I’m out of date, but in most respects, these are peoplethat are in places that are important to us, in some of the key engineering areasand working with really great professors. They often have their eye to doingsomething of an entrepreneurial nature, and so we want to know who they are.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you have any statistics about how those fellowship programs actually payoff?Myers: No. I think people here would, because they’re still active and have now beengoing for about eight or ten years, but I’m out of date.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is Mayfield in any way unusual in sponsoring fellowships of that nature?Myers: I’m not sure. I know back when we started this, I was transitioning. We wereanxious to put our name on it, which forced us to put some more money up todo it. So there may not be. But other venture capitalists find their own way,and I can’t rattle them off, but you know, Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia. They’reall around. All of these schools, just going back to a prior conversation, haveintegrated themselves to the community, the corporations that come in therethey use that as part of the outside classroom, so they’re all very open to it. Sothe venture capitalists are all around, one way or the other. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: The historical literature gives Stanford pride of place in being venturesome interms of reaching out to industry. Berkeley is regarded as slower on the draw.Do you have enough contact with the Berkeley campus to know who mighthave been behind pushing for greater interaction with the businesscommunity?Myers: Not really. One of our advisors was [A.] Richard Newton, who was dean ofthe engineering school at Berkeley. And he died, unfortunately, a year and ahalf ago. He had been with us for fifteen years. He was a professor atBerkeley and then he worked his way up. Great guy. I don’t know who wasthere before or what happened, but he had that foresight. He raised a few hundred million dollars, built a corporate computer-aideddesign center and brought corporations into it and venture capitalists. He wasthinking that way, and so I think they very much have a presence, but prior tothat they were very quiet. I don’t know why or who was there. And Stanfordwas in our back yard. It was much easier. We all had the Stanfordconnections, and so forth.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Back to the general venture capital questions. I think I know how you’re goingto answer this. Would you say that venture capital is a spur to innovation?That it has a good process for selecting firms or entrepreneurs that are likelyto be innovative, or is it more due to management developing a firm so that itis productive.Myers: Both. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That’s what I suspected you were going to say! [chuckling]Myers: Yes, it is both. First is the screen—is this thing any good, addressing a bigenough market, can you build a company around it, can you attract capital?All those kinds of questions. And often the entrepreneurs aren’t in a positionto answer those very well. They might have a great idea, but they don’t have abroader perspective.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And you don’t expect it of them?Myers: Not necessarily.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That’s your role. Myers: Yes, exactly. Somebody used to say is, “One way to become a really goodventure capitalist is to see all the business plans there are.” And so we wouldactually try to measure what percent of all the plans, or all the opportunitiesthat we see—80 percent, 90 percent—because if you see most of them, aftersome time you begin to figure out—Hey this is some good stuff, this isn’t sogood. Just a simple piece of the equation. So you don’t expect entrepreneursto know that, so it very much is a screen where the venture capitalistshopefully have some perspective knowledge. Right, all that, but they do havethe perspective to screen it and say, “This has a chance.” But then once you’ve done that, that’s the start of a long process. That’s whereI think the venture capitalists really have their added value, [which] is to helpbuild the team. And I think I mentioned before being—I think we sort ofspecialized on helping build a team. Other venture capitalists did too. Sequoiawas really good at the marketing side of things, because that was DonValentine’s background, and Pierre’s [Lamond]. Kleiner Perkins had theoperations stuff, so they were very operational, very hands-on. They would bechairman of the board and almost running things at the time, which othersdidn’t. But in all regards, it’s just kind of like each person is trying to find away, or each group find a way, to build this thing and make it successful. Sothat’s why it’s both.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I read somewhere that—and I can’t even tell you what stage in Mayfield’shistory it was—it had a reputation for being very strong in communication.Myers: You mean communication sector?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: No, I meant being very interactive with entrepreneurs.Myers: We worked at that. Kleiner might be the operations people; a little unpleasantto be with and you didn’t want to necessarily go to a party with them. Sequoiakind of that way too, but fantastic marketing. We were the friends of theentrepreneurs. That’s how we positioned ourselves. We fired our share andhad our differences, but we really felt like we were in a partnership and we’dwork with a team and with the chief person to make this so they’d have trustin us and if we say, “It’s time to step aside, and here’s why. Here’s what weshould be doing,” that we wouldn’t fight about it too much but like, “Okay, Iunderstand.” Have a relationship that we could talk it through. So that’s verymuch how we positioned ourselves.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were you a little unusual in having experience in a high-tech company?Tommy Davis, as we talked about, was in land management. Myers: Right, exactly. And then, you know, Institutional Ventures, IVP [InstitutionalVenture Partners]—Reid Dennis started that—although some of the partnersdid [have high-tech experience]. But it’s a mixture, but by and large you’reright.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But did you stand out in the early Mayfield because you had been at HP andconsequently knew a) about high tech, and b) about working at and managinga Silicon Valley company. Did that distinguish you in any way?Myers: I don’t know! [laughing] Beats me. It was just such a different time then. Ididn’t become a partner till the second fund. Back then, it was very much thetwo of them, and I was the associate. I wasn’t equal to them at all, in terms ofstature or my accomplishments or anything else. I remember talking toTommy in the mid-seventies saying, “You guys are always on all the boards. Iwant to go on a board. I want to get more involved.” “Oh, young man, yourtime will come. You’ll have more boards than you can deal with.” Whichhappened, but that took ten years. Now today it doesn’t, because there’s ademand, and it’s a whole different deal. But back then, it was kind of a club.The type of person’s changed. I never could get a job today. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why do you say that?Myers: Well, because—because the demands are that the person step in, beproductive very quickly. You don’t have five years to see how it’s going.There are a whole bunch of dynamics. First of all, everybody’s paid more.You’re expected to get some ownership in the firm almost from the beginning.I didn’t get ownership until five, six years into it. And then I was loaned somemoney, and so forth.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And that was standard from firm to firm?Myers: No, they hadn’t hired young people. It was a brand new thing. I may havebeen one of the earlier associates. I don’t know who else had associates.Kleiner Perkins, all had principals, but no associates at the time. So I was kindof a new category. So today, the expectations are very high, so you hire people—typically they’repeople that have had ten years of industry, and they’ve done spectacularlywell: they’ve led this, they’ve led that, they’ve started this, they’ve startedthat. And they’ve done it in areas that you’re looking for. So if Mayfield needssomebody that’s in the Internet space or communications space, you look forthe ten-year entrepreneur that’s done all this stuff and they’ve been really successful. Then you hire them, you pay them a lot of money, you give them alot of ownership, and they’re expected to, day one, bring in deals, know howto assess deals, and help companies. So it’s a whole different model today.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How is it working? Because I’ve done a fair amount of interviewing in thebiotech industry, and I’ve been struck by how many of those people, as theyage, move into venture capital.Myers: From biotech?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes.Myers: Coming from an operating background is kind of the way—it’s been that wayfor the last ten or fifteen years. That’s very important. You’ve got to know thetechnology, you’ve got to know the players. It’s just a given that they’ve gotto come out of the Genentechs or the technology companies around, otherwise[they] don’t know the players and [they] don’t know what [they]’re dealingwith. To be able to invest successfully, there is a learning curve. There are twoaspects to that: some people are just operating people. It’s a whole differentworld to go to work, make things happen, be tangible, grow this, it’s reallyyours. And those people don’t transition to venture capital very well, becausethey want to operate. And venture capital, you’re one or two steps removedfrom that, and you’re advising. You have a relationship. You have a bunch ofcompanies. You can’t spend the time, so some just don’t like it for that reason,or don’t make it as a venture capitalist. But the second thing is, if you brought someone over, what you hope is that asthey—you’ve got the whole partnership then working, so when you sit aroundthe table, and there are five or six or eight partners, you might be the newperson, but your naiveté on the investment side is sort of compensated by therest of the group. And so you might think this [proposal] is spectacular andit’s got to go through, or that you like an investment, but the other partnerssay, “But you haven’t thought of this, this, and this.” “Oh, really, well, wait—I never thought about those things.” And so that’s where it sort of comestogether. But it’s much more important today to have the fundamental knowledge ofwhat you’re investing in, which has become more complex, more fastmoving, et cetera. You’ve got to have that or it’s a non-starter.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Doesn’t that lead to a lot of specialization within firms? Myers: Oh yes, definitely.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And is that yet another change from the way things started out?Myers: Oh yes. There were generalists, and generalists did fine for a long time, but inthe late eighties we hired Yogen Dalal out of Apple. He’d been at Apple andthen at one of their spin-offs, and he’s a software guy. So he was one of theearly designers of the Internet at Stanford with PARC [Palo Alto ResearchCenter] and all that. It was obvious—you had to have this expertise that knewthe networks, knew where the people were, knew where the deals were. Andso that’s continued to go on. Biotech is just as specialized. Highly specialized.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Let’s go back to your story about ownership.Myers: Well, when I joined, I didn’t understand the company. I was so naïve I didn’tknow about ownership. But they hadn’t hired young people. So Tommy andWally were the general partners, having most of what they call the carry in thefund.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Which is a given percentage?Myers: Yes.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And is it usually the same from firm to firm?Myers: It moves around, but back in those days, or even today—it used to be 20percent—so 20, 25, or 30 percent. And that meant that the general partnerswould get that percentage of the profits of the firm when liquidity occurred.Actually that’s a whole different story, but anyway, at some point in time, you[percent], and then Kleiner Perkins and we and others went to 25, and thenpercent.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It that a recent escalation?Myers: No. That all happened in the early nineties, 30 percent. But when I joined, thesenior two, Tommy and Wally, had that ownership for themselves. And Ithink they shared a little bit with Stanford or somebody else. After being therefor a few years I said, “Well, you know, I understand how this works, so can I 40have some ownership?” And that was an unknown concept. There was novehicle to do that. Now, all the legal work’s been figured out. It’s very easy to do. [Then] it waslike, “Oh God, I don’t know how we do this.” And so Tommy lent me$30,000 to invest as a limited partner. Now that was very nice of him, butthat’s really not the same thing. It’s a loan. I owe him $30,000; I was payinginterest on it, and if the fund didn’t do well, I still owe him $30,000! Whereas,if you’re a general partner, you have to put up some money, but basically itcomes almost for free. And if the fund goes away, you haven’t lost anymoney. I mean, it’s not quite that simple, but almost. And then that first fund wasn’t particularly successful. I think it just had abouta 4 or 5 percent return. This was in ‘76-’77—I wasn’t even sure I could payTommy back. I didn’t have any money. And then luckily, kind of at the lastminute, Storage Technology and a few companies did really well, and I paidhim back and made $10,000. So anyway, that whole concept of ownership was not well established. As webegan to add partners and others did, then we figured out the legal mechanismfor taking an existing carry and splitting it up in different ways. And today it’sjust expected. If you’re a pretty senior person joining a venture firm, you’reexpected to get ownership in the firm.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What about becoming a partner then and now?Myers: Same thing. It was just slower then. I became a partner in Mayfield II, a little,itty-bitty partner. But that was five, six years into it. And today a seniorperson would come in, probably, as a partner. You might have some otherjunior and some interns—not everybody in the firm is a partner today. Thereare twenty people out there, twenty-five, so not everyone is a partner, ofcourse, but they do—there are tiers and you figure it out. But at least there’s avehicle.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is it very much performance-based how you move into partnership?Myers: Well, if you’re senior in what you’ve done, accomplished a lot, then you cancome in as a partner right away.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Right. But if you haven’t?Myers: If you haven’t, we’d start somebody with a fairly small partnership interest,and if they really did well—I mean, some of the companies were very successful, then—now they were getting only a small portion of those profitsbecause they had a small interest. So we also had—we would do a couple ofthings: occasionally within a fund we would change their ownership, whichwas fairly complicated to do, but we’d increase their respective share. Orcertainly in the next fund then, because their portfolio had done well, we’dincrease the ownership in the next fund.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I see. And presumably it can also move the other way.Myers: Down. Yes, that happened some.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Probably less common?Myers: Yes. It’s such a fuzzy business. Even measuring performance is—over timeyou can for sure, but who’s doing well, who made a critical hire, who helpedsomebody else. Maybe my partner was the key man on the deal, but I didsomething that it might not have survived without it. So what’s what, youknow? So we tried very hard to not dice it up and figure out exactly who didwhat and who was better. Inevitably we did that, because you just kind ofhave to recognize the differences.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, you spoke last time, and maybe congenial wasn’t quite the word youused, but I definitely got the impression from what you said that Mayfield wasa cooperative group, and there wasn’t a lot of backbiting until fairly recently.Myers: Right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You were looking after each other’s interests to a degree.Myers: Oh yes. No, it was a very congenial group, and then we prided ourselves onthat and it was one of these things where we felt that the group would begreater than the whole—or however you say that. [The whole is greater thanthe sum of the parts.]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And would you consider that to be a distinguishing characteristic of Mayfield?Myers: Yes. Now we lost a lot of that in the late nineties, but certainly during thatperiod that was definitely true. I think we had some partners who did just afew deals. I think I mentioned last time, we hired Bill Unger to do searchwork and headhunting for the company. So he made huge contributions, but he had ownership, but you couldn’t say that it was his deals, and so forth. Sowe liked that. Other firms had gone more on the superstar model, and onceagain, competitive pressure—we saw we had to go that way too. And there’sstill quite a bit of that where a person has a fiefdom—the John Doerr, BrookByers fiefdom. They did it their own way and got what they wanted. Weavoided that as long as we could, but then in the late nineties—that’s when ithappened.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And the discord, if that’s the word, that began to appear in the 1990s, wasthat, at least in part, a function of the greater competitiveness within the fielditself?Myers: Oh yes, I think so. Absolutely right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And more so than just the mix of personalities?Myers: Well, the personality mix didn’t change much until the late nineties. So, Idon’t know what the answer is exactly. Say it again? I’m kind of lost.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I was wondering how much of it was circumstance, the fact that ventureinvestment had become more competitive, consequently the individuals withinit were forced to be more competitive. Or was it just that you happened tohave a certain set of individuals at Mayfield who were more aggressive thanthe group before.Myers: It’s a little of each. Clearly it became more competitive. I’m thinking of one ortwo people that we hired that were really good, and they did really, reallywell. And then they stood up and said, “Hey, look what I did! I made thisenormous contribution, so I really want a lot more ownership. I don’t want tojust go by the old measures, I want a lot more.” And that began to be a problem. And then we started measuring everybodymore carefully. Oh okay, well, this person hasn’t done anything useful orhasn’t made any money for five years, so is that person no longer useful?Should their ownership be reduced? What do you do with it? You get intovery complicated issues, and that went against the culture that wedeveloped—Hey, let’s all work for the common good.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What turned it around?Myers: Oh, it didn’t really get turned around. I think we went to the competitiveculture. I left Mayfield not because of that, but that’s kind of where it was going. Mayfield had some hard times, because they’ve had some personalitieshere that were really conflicts and difficult to deal with and that, franklyhaven’t—well, they’re sorted out now, but it took ten years to sort out.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was your departure premised largely on that?Myers: Oh no, not at all. No, I was just ready to leave. I wanted to leave, that was it.I’m out of here. I think, in hindsight, I left too fast. Maybe if I’d stayedanother four or five years or part-time and all that, I could have been morehelpful in smoothing this transition or figuring out some of these things. Butthe leadership changed, I zapped out, and then there was all these marketpressures. The stock market was going crazy, the dot-com boom and all this,and it became very complicated. [chuckling]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Would you talk about the process behind taking a company public?Myers: Well, today there’s no relationship to then, so I guess my frame of referencewas eighties and nineties, because after the dot-com boom the investmentbanks collapsed or reduced, and there were very few IPOs for four or fiveyears. There are a few more recently, but now the regulations on going publicare so complicated that many companies are being acquired. And then wehave the current financial mess. So I can’t really speak to today, except thatthey almost don’t go public.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes, well speak about back in time.Myers: Well, the ultimate goal in those days was to go public. Being acquired wasokay, but you didn’t get as good a return. That’s shifted now, today. Butanyway, then, to go public, you just had a huge responsibility, because thecompany had to perform, and if you didn’t, then the Milberg Weiss group andother lawyers were out there to sue you. And so there was just a lot of scrutiny as a public company. So we were verycareful, as I think most people, until the boom of 2000 where everything wasgoing public. We were very careful that we were ready; we had a completemanagement team, the holes were filled, the company was doing well, all thenumbers were lining up, there was a backlog. We see where we’re going—allthe characteristics were lining up. So that was the main thing: is yourcompany really ready? Do you have a real business here?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And does that mean profits and product? Myers: It may not quite mean profits, but they’re around the corner or they’re nextyear. It clearly means that you have product and you have real customers thatare buying, and buying increasing amounts. Your revenues are doubling everyyear or some such thing, so you’re really growing. And you may or may nothave profits—and that profit criteria would come and go. In boom cycles itwould go and in down cycles it would come back, kind of thing. And then in2000 everything went away—didn’t have to have revenues, didn’t have tohave anything—just go public. But nevertheless, in those earlier times, we really wanted a quality companythat we thought could be there for the long term, and that includes a goodboard of directors. And then after that you go to the investment bankers, andthere’s a whole process that I didn’t personally do, but the more you’reinvolved—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: But somebody at Mayfield did?Myers: No, the banker work—we had relationships. We knew the bankers, the FrankQuattrones and Eff Martins and all the rest. So we might start it and say, “Eff,I’ve got a company I’ve been working with and I think you really ought totake a look at it.” “Okay.” They’d go down and talk, and the company wouldput on their show, would talk about it, and we’d begin to see if they wereinterested. Once again, it was part of the network the venture capitalists wouldbring to bear, because sometimes the company wouldn’t know these people.So we’d have those relationships and bring them to the company.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do investment banks tend to be more heavily into one technology, oneindustry than another? Or are they just simply looking for what they feel is agood business?Myers: Pretty much good business and can they make money. They make all theirmoney when they go public, but then they—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because they take—do they call it a carry?Myers: Yes, they take a percentage of the sales. So if they go to raise $100 milliondollars, I forgot what it is, they take 4 or 5, 6 percent as their commission fordoing the deal. So that’s where all the money was made for them. But then, inthose days, when they went public, they did have to support it, which meantthat they had to have an analyst, analyst reports, and educate the public, andoften there’d be a core group that would buy the securities in the beginning.But then you had to spread out the ownership, and they would help do that in the old days. And that all fell apart, but that’s the way it used to be. Anyway,there was a whole process that they had to go through.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What happened when it fell apart?Myers: You mean when the dot-com boom fell apart?<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Yes. All that due diligence, if you can call it that, went out the window? Wereinvestment banks as guilty as the entrepreneurs?Myers: Oh yes, oh absolutely. Well, it’s just like the mortgage cycle. In a way, whenit’s happening you don’t see it or you are not so aware. But the public was soanxious to buy these technology shares that everybody that went public wouldgo up like double or triple the next day, and that was incredible—it’s foundmoney. And so once that started, it was like a gold rush. It was like, “Oh my God!That’s really cool.” And so more and more people wanted to play that game.So it sort of starts with a very small group, but then others want to get—andso anyway, there’s a group spread. Finally, in the boom times, you had all thepublic through retail brokers, all wanting to participate in these huge stockgains and make their money and flip it and turn it out. And then they would dothat, but it went on for a long time. So there were more of them and more ofthem. After a while you say, “Wow. This is the way it’s going to be! This isreally great and look at all the money we’re all making.” And that’s a boom.That’s how these bubbles are created. And all of a sudden someone would say, “Hey, the emperor has no clothes.There’s nothing here.” And then companies weren’t performing. They’d saythey have some new technology, a new whiz-bang; they’d go public. All of asudden it wasn’t there, or it would be a year before it was there. So it just gotway, way overpriced, like a hundred times, two hundred times.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Genentech must have been in the first Mayfield fund, right?Myers: That was actually the second fund.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Kleiner Perkins was the original investor, but I thought that Mayfield came inin the second round, and I thought it was 1977.Myers: I think it was ’77-‘78. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you have anything to say about that investment? Here you had a companywith an entirely new technology, no products, no profits. It must have been aterribly speculative and risky thing.Myers: I knew Bob Swanson. We were venture capitalists. He was at Citibank. Weplayed tennis, and all that. And then he left and he started working on thisproject, I think it was at MIT.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, he went, of course, to Kleiner Perkins. It was Kleiner and Perkins inthose days.Myers: Right. He went there. And so that’s how that relationship started. I don’tremember the story all that well, but when Bob had the idea of the DNA andthen—and so he did start that with Kleiner Perkins. To seed something in youroffices and then do that was pretty unusual.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because you knew him, were you the connection with Mayfield? In otherwords, a quicker way of saying it is why did Mayfield get involved withGenentech?Myers: I don’t remember how exactly. Tommy Davis had more of a relationship withthe company, and he introduced Corning to it. Corning Glass, which was acritical introduction; Corning put in a lot of money, went on the board, andreally helped them in those early days. We never went on the board. And soTommy worked on that more than I did.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, Corning was later. Corning was the early eighties.Myers: Oh, I thought it was earlier. I don’t remember exactly.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Of course, that was a tremendously successful investment achievement.Myers: And it really has been one of those companies built to last, unlike most. Mostventure companies are gone. They get acquired or they just pfft, go away.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you credit Bob Swanson for that?Myers: Yes, Bob was really good. Bob was a great guy. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did you keep in touch with him over time?Myers: Yes. We were friends, just friends over time.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Were you talking back and forth in the days when he was trying to make uphis mind whether to go with recombinant DNA or not?Myers: No.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you have anything more to say about the relationship between venturecapital and universities? How important is academia in the whole equation ofventure capital investment?Myers: Well, it’s very important today. It’s evolved. At the beginning it wasn’t veryimportant, because what comes out of academia usually is a long ways frombeing able to commercialize it. So in the seventies and a good part of theeighties, it was interesting and you’d go look. You’d go over to SRI [StanfordResearch Institute], same thing, and you’d look at what they had and [go],“Oh that’s interesting.” But we don’t have anybody to run it and [get] thistechnology even to a prototype stage. And so, da, da, da, you didn’t havemuch interest. It got more competitive in the mid-eighties, and I think that then that all beganto change. So two of the Mayfield [investments]—Silicon Graphics and MIPSboth came out of Stanford. Now at the same time, Stanford was doing thingsthat were more commercially applicable, unlike a lot of university research.That probably goes back to Terman and relationships in the Valley, so that theSilicon Graphics terminal concept was a real-life thing that people could useand work on, so it wasn’t just research. And that allowed [them] to form thebasis for pulling that out, and MIPS the same thing. So it evolved. And we backed other things out of Stanford. We backed aprojection system that went nowhere. It wasn’t ready.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: A projection of what?Myers: For digital theater projections. It’s like these gadgets, but much earlier, thatwe thought would be interesting. So I think it’s clear today that universitiesare very important. They’re doing some of the, in fact, some of the researchleft in the country are being done at universities, so— <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And university administrations are much more proactive, are they not, informing relationships with industry?Myers: Oh yes. Well, and they’ve got their licensing act together, which no one hadtogether [earlier]. For years, Stanford got nothing out of all this technologycoming out, which was not right somehow.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And UC, my understanding is, was even behind Stanford.Myers: Oh yes. Well, they all were. It took a long time to figure this out. I don’t evenknow how they do it today, but they’re aggressive. [laughs]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [chuckling] They get their money, that’s for sure!Myers: This is our stuff. We’re paying for it. We want part of it. As they should have.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What do you consider to be your greatest strength?Myers: Hmm. I don’t like these things. [chuckling] I don’t know what my strength is!I guess at Mayfield, I thought my contribution was mostly the team, andbuilding a team, keeping the team working together, keeping a culture thatwas productive. I thought I was an okay venture capitalist, but I thought as amanager of a team—that was my greater strength.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And you liked that best?Myers: Yes, I did. I liked it a lot. I liked the company thing, too. But I spent a fairamount of my time as the managing partner, trying to make that part work too.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Why did venture capital originate in this country, and why has it been mostsuccessful in this country?Myers: Well, it really is Silicon Valley. All the rest—well, or in Boston. I don’t knowwhat the numbers are now, but for a long, long time, what happened in SiliconValley eclipsed everything else in the country by a long ways. And I think itwas the confluence of these things—it goes back to Dean Terman, it goesback to Stanford, it goes back to a West Coast approach to life versus the restof the world. It’s the Wild West—sure we can do it—not the Wild Westanalogy exactly, but it’s “Sure we can do it.” It’s a big world; it’s a positive outlook. It’s like—“I don’t really care what your background is—so youfailed at three companies. If you can do this, you’re on, and I’ll give you ashot at it.” Still today you can’t do it on the East Coast much. Still today—it’slike—[imitating a condescending person] “Well, you didn’t work here. Yourresume doesn’t look very good. Why should we hire you?” It’s a wholedifferent attitude.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And that still holds on in the east? Even with the West Coast as a model?Myers: Oh absolutely. You can’t over generalize on these things, but I have somefriends that are in the investment business. They don’t want to work on theEast Coast. It’s just too snooty and what kind of racquetball court do youbelong to, and which club, and what’s your resume—it’s all this sort ofgobbledygoop. Out here, it’s like—“Take off your tie. Let’s get to work and get somethingdone.” So it’s a whole different approach to life and attitude and, “Let’s trysomething new. Let’s try alternative medicine.” Let’s do this, let’s do that. Soit’s that attitude of: We can build something. A lot of the entrepreneurs, you look at their backgrounds—Nolan Bushnell—and many others have no apparent background for doing what they’re doing.[chuckling] In fact, somebody [may] wonder: How did we ever get here? Howdid we back them? I don’t [have] all the words for it. I haven’t thought aboutit for a while. You throw in a kind of attitude, almost a culture of, Let’s just do it. We canget things done. And the technology and the Stanford and smart people. So itwas here and then it went to L.A. and Boston a little bit. The rest of thecountry tried to do it. Not very successfully at all, and now people are tryingto do it all over the world. Obviously, it must work in some ways, but I thinkit’s also because of the interconnected flat world and all the rest of that stuffthat you can do these things today. I haven’t thought about how to integrate what’s happening in China, India,and all these other things. They’re very entrepreneur[ial] cultures. When yougo visit, you’re really impressed by it. But they didn’t have the universitybackground, they’ve got a technology background and all that stuff.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, the things that you’ve been talking about I think you could put under theculture umbrella. What about some of the more boring things, like taxstructure, that may have been a boon to getting new enterprises off theground? 50Myers: You know, it probably did, but back when this all started, we had our 70percent tax structure, and capital gains got some break, but it wasn’t as big ofa break. Clearly taxes accelerated it, when they made the big differentiation,the capital gains differentiation, and then we and others found a way to set upthese partnerships. So it’s two pieces—it’s the huge tax benefits, setting uppartnerships so that the general partners could have the ownership position Italked about and have their profits taxed as capital gains. That was a very,very tricky thing in the early seventies. That was kind of a legal breakthroughhow to do that. But that was just for that side. On the entrepreneurial side, I don’t really know the history, but the fact thatthe stock options—same thing—you get all that appreciation of the optionsand taxed as capital gains—I don’t quite when that came in. The stock optionwas a phenomenal incentive, phenomenal incentive. So yes, it played a bigrole, probably the biggest one.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: In the areas of the world, China and India, et cetera, that are beginning todevelop venture capital, have they introduced tax laws that are also—Myers: Good question. I have no idea. [chuckling] I will ask that. That’d be veryinteresting to know.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Can you say anything about how venture capital has affected, impacted theU.S. economy? Is that just too general a question?Myers: It’s too general. It’s made an enormous impact, it created thousands of jobs.It’s been the best thing ever! [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Touché!Myers: Lots of fantastic companies have come out of that, a lot of really qualitycompanies and a lot of jobs. They still collect, I’m sure, these numbers forCongress and other people. I’m not up to date on the meaning of it all.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You’ve certainly done a good job of commenting on how venture capital haschanged during your career. But have we left anything out? Is there more thatyou would like to say about the changes?Myers: I don’t think so. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You kindly this morning sent me the names of a handful of companies that wemight discuss. So I will just simply go through your list, which started withSimplex Systems. Why that investment, and is there anything particular thatyou’d like to bring out about it?Myers: Well, that was an example of an investment of two entrepreneurs, twotechnical people out of the University of Illinois with a CAD, computer-aideddesign system or technology. It really came to us through Richard Newton,who was the Berkeley person, and that was his specialty area, so he knewabout their technology and how they were doing it, thought this wasimportant. I thought they were purchased in the mid-nineties, anyway, ’95-’96.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Oh that late?Myers: Yes, a little later. And I guess I thought of that only because it was sort ofwhat we were doing then. We had some technologists that were very good,didn’t know how to run a company. We agreed to give them money on theproviso that we’d bring in a CEO at the right time. We funded them for abouta year or so, and Rich was on the board, and I went on the board and in fact, afew other people. But as the technology began to evolve, we needed a CEO.And then what so often happens is the key guy didn’t want to—said, “No. Idon’t want to do that. I want to be CEO now. I’m here. I don’t want to dilutemy stock—this and that. I mentioned it because I felt good about it in that I had a good enoughrelationship with Rez Salek to convince him to open the door, by getting toknow him and spending time and all that, allowing us to go look forsomebody. We found a woman named Penny Herscher to come in and run it,who was a fantastic person and she built the company and sold it to—<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Cadence?Myers: Cadence. But I guess I just think of that because that’s where, I think, theventure capitalists play a really important role. If they’d been left to their owndevices, it would have been a disaster. But we got the door opened and gottheir confidence and Rez later thanked me. He said, “God, thanks for doingthat.”<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, then there was another CADcompany— Myers: Cadnetix.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Any connection there?Myers: No, none at all. That was the early eighties, Cadnetix.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was CAD a new thing then?Myers: No. CAD’s been around. Doing a chip layout and board layout and all that.It’s been around for a long time, but it’s evolved, and it’s in itself critical tounderlying technology to all of this stuff, because no longer can mortal humanbeings figure this stuff out. So the computer programs that do this were led alot by Richard; that was his specialty at Berkeley. And Berkeley is a center, itstill remains a center for the cutting-edge technology of getting all this stuffon a chip so it all works. So that was one of his specialty areas. But we didn’tknow Richard then.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: So not necessarily just CAD on chips, but general systems on chips.Myers: Well, it’s getting all the components of a semiconductor chip to all go in theright places and interact and work together. So you might have a littlethingamajigger, and it’d have a few million parts on it. So how do you get allthose interconnected and working and multi-layer? It’s very, very complex.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And that was what Newton was—Myers: That was his specialty. In fact, his PhD students—he had design teams; he hadrelationships with major companies all around that subject. He was also on theboard of Synopsys and a number of the companies in the Valley doing this. Sohe was the kind of guy we wanted to have part of us because he knew all thisstuff. And so Simplex was just one example of a technology company hebrought to us for that.Cadnetix was totally different. That was in Boulder, Colorado, and we had anaffiliate we worked with in Boulder. Bruce [M.] Holland, the CEO of thatcompany. So our affiliate found Bruce; we invested with Bruce, and then thatwas sort of a different deal. And then, actually, Bruce started anothercompany called SpectraLink which we also, in fact, invested in.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was that unusual for you to have investments out of the state? Myers: Well, not over time. Up until the mid-eighties, we definitely stayed inCalifornia.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Was that was a deliberate decision?Myers: Yes. We didn’t want to travel and, once again, when you’ve got a hands-on,go to board meetings, get to know the people, if they’re far away, you can’t doit. Once again—lots of competition [and] it changed. So there was a lothappening in Boulder, and so we had an affiliate there which was our first stepin that direction. So another partnership that we helped them raise money andI was on the advisory board. This was the Hill Partnership, and so they wereinvesting in their local area. I’d go there once a month and we’d look ateverything they were looking at. They found a number of things. This wasone—Cadnetix, that they had a local relationship—they knew the entrepreneurand then we got involved on the board.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: If you have an affiliate in the picture, I would assume that that cuts down onthe profit that Mayfield might have made.Myers: Yes, but for an early stage, there was room for everybody. Well, there wasor $4 million funds. They’d put up $200,000 or $300,000, and back then wewere putting up $0.5 million or so. Burt McMurtry came into that. I don’tknow quite how he came in, but he was part of that. So anyway, you’re right,but otherwise we wouldn’t be there.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is Mayfield now all over the show?Myers: Oh yes, they evolved. So then we started some biotech companies in the EastCoast, and certainly down in southern California, and now we’re in Indiana.Yes, so everywhere.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: For a company that, at least in the early days, was emphasizing personalrelations—that must have changed.Myers: Oh, it did. It’s not as good. That’s why we resisted for so long, because—well,first of all, it’s impossible to do a pure startup, some really early-stagetechnologies, you just can’t do that at that distance.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Because it takes so much hands-on? Myers: It’s hands-on, you’re there a lot, you’re seeing them a few times a week andeverything else, and you’re helping them build the team. And then whenthey’re far away, you just can’t do those things. So we evolved that by justworking with others. So the biotech team here, led by Grant Heidrich and afew others, they had relationships in the Boston area. So a Boston venturecapitalist would maybe find the deal and get something going, and then wewould come along with them. We’d still go on the board, but they wouldspend more local time than we were able to spend. That was true all over. Wedid this Hill Partnership in Boulder because they were there all the time. Imean, the lion’s share. But it just gets harder and harder. They’re still doing it.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Another one is SpectraLink?Myers: Well, that came out of Cadnetix, so that was Bruce Holland, the sameentrepreneur in both cases. SpectraLink was making essentially a wirelesstelephone system, commercial grade.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Way back?Myers: No, this is ’93, I think. He did this after Cadnetix. It was the early nineties thatBruce started this company, and then it actually did go public and then gotmerged a few years ago. But that’s another company where we got to knowBruce Holland. He was starting a new company and we had a goodrelationship, so he said, “I’m starting a new company. Let’s get going.” Here’sa proven entrepreneur, which is really easy, because we knew him, we likedhim a lot, he built good teams. So anyway, that was just all I wanted with that.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Good illustration of the importance of personal relationships and experience.How do you pronounce M-I-P-S [spells].Myers: MIPS. MIPS Computer Systems.Well, what was interesting about that one issimply, as I mentioned earlier, that was John Hennesy and group spinning outof Stanford to do that. That was also one of the earlier ones where weincubated them at our offices, so they were in our offices for six months ormore developing their business plan. And then two of us, Grant Heidrich andmyself, both went on the board. We went and found a president—that initialfounding group from the beginning knew they wouldn’t be president, so wehelped them find Bob [Robert C.] Miller, the president. So it was a companythat was big ownership; we put a lot of time into the same kinds of things—building a team, working on strategy, helping do fundraising rounds, that sortof thing. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: The last one on your list is Latitude Communications.Myers: That company was sold to Cisco [Systems, Inc.] a few years ago. They weremaking a telephone conferencing system. It goes way back. It’s a group wehad been following; I was on the board. I don’t know what to say about it. Idon’t know what to draw out. These were all fairly early stage; we had largeownership positions. You work with the team, you help to build people. Youcritique it. One thing I haven’t mentioned much, but another thing you try todo is help them introduce new customers. [We] had the credibility they oftendon’t have, and promote their product and so forth.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And how do you do that?Myers: Well, when we know customers, we have relationships, so if we knewsomebody at Cisco or some other company—it’s a fledgling startup. You lookfor help from every direction. And so if we have a relationship with a largercompany, or Hewlett-Packard, then we’ll sort of make the connection, “Youought to consider these guys,” So as a venture capitalist, you just try to help inevery way you can in building the company.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What about a failure or two? Maybe with some lessons to learn from that.Myers: I didn’t go over the list thinking about failures. Well, there’s one East Baycompany—I also don’t like to talk about it, because the people are stillaround.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You don’t have to name names.Myers: The East Bay company with a computer product for companies. The problemwas the CEO, who didn’t hire very well, was stubborn, and we couldn’t gethim out. He was an articulate guy, he kept raising money somehow, but hewasn’t performing.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: You mean by performing he wasn’t making money?Myers: Wasn’t making his plans, where he’d said we’d sell this many systems. It wasa computer printing product—and we’d sell this many systems, and hewouldn’t do that; he’d sell one instead of five and then have an excuse for it.And then the next quarter and the next quarter. So when that begins to happen,Okay, what’s wrong here? And it’s usually some part of the team isn’t right. And the CEO was a pretty good guy, but he just didn’t hire well, and so hedidn’t have good sales people, didn’t have good marketing people, and theycouldn’t execute on the plan. And so after several attempts at him trying to—not hiring well, then you say, “Well, okay, then you’re the problem, becausewe’ve got to get these people in here.” And then he fought not to get pushedout, and so this was actually very exciting. It doesn’t happen very often whereyou have a shareholder vote to actually push a guy out. That’s really unusual.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Which Mayfield had to orchestrate?Myers: Yes, exactly right.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How do you go about doing that?Myers: Well, there are not so many shares—it’s not a public company, so you knowwho all the shareholders [are]. But you’ve got to go to other venturecapitalists. And in this case, there were a lot of individuals that had stock fromearlier days before we got involved, and they sided with management. We hadthe major investors siding with us. You actually get into a fight where peopleare organizing votes and a shareholder meeting, and you’re going to vote forthis or vote for that. We brought in another guy over other people’s objectionsand installed him, and he didn’t do a very good job, and so now we had mudon our face. When that happens it’s like you’re spending twenty-four hours a day workingon one mess. It probably won’t come out very well in the end, so it’s a—Ishouldn’t say it’s a complete waste of time, but usually when it gets into amess like that, you would have been better off to walk away at the beginning.But you can’t walk away. You’re the lead investor, there are other investorsinvesting with you, so you can’t just say, “I’m tired of this. I want out ofhere.” You’ve got to work it through and try to make the best of it, but sell it ifit goes anywhere.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: If you could organize all the venture capitalists to get out—what would thatbig process be? They’ve invested their people’s money—how do you get outof a deal that’s going bad?Myers: You don’t get out of it. As I said, sometimes you just feel like you’d like towalk away, get off the board, not put all the time into it because that’s justwasted time. But you can’t do that, because at the beginning you think youcan help or fix it, or if we did this or did that. So you go down that path. Andthen the investors don’t always agree; some agree, some don’t.  And so now you need to raise some money, because usually this happensabout the time they’re running out of money. So we want to raise money—well, some investors want to put up money and some don’t. So now what doyou do? You make it more and more attractive, and so you say, “All right. Forthose that put up money, you get a larger and larger ownership. If you don’tput up money, it’s being more and more punitive. There are all kinds ofmechanisms people figured out to make it this way. But then, the ones thatdon’t want to put up money, put up a fight—“Oh, you aren’t being fair.” Andmaybe they have a lawsuit or do something else because they haven’t beentreated properly. And it just turns into a nightmare of gobbledygoop and mess.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Situations like that I hope are not too common.Myers: No, they’re not too common.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Did they keep you awake at night?Myers: Oh yes, exactly, because you’re the lead person and you’re trying to juggle allthese things and trying to make something of it. That’s why you’re doing allthis. And so yes, it just totally consumes you for weeks while you’re doingthis, and it usually doesn’t go anywhere in the end.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: And is that company still stammering along?Myers: No, the CEO is stammering along. He’s actually started another company andsome people are, “Maybe he’s doing better this time around.” I haven’tfollowed him much. We didn’t part the best of friends.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: [laughing] I can well imagine!Myers: The more typical thing, though, is that you’ll sell a company. You’ll say,“You know, the market isn’t as big, the product doesn’t work as well as wethought, so the opportunity just isn’t what it was here.” So you’re sitting downwith the CEO [saying]— As a lead investor, part of your job is to raisemoney, so [you say], “I don’t think we can raise the money. I don’t thinkthere’s the interest. We don’t have a good enough story. So let’s try to sell it.”And that’s another whole process where often a venture capitalist is prettyhelpful in the sales process. Maybe the venture capitalist would know peopleto go to, or you hire an investment bank that does the more formal research.  They used to say—well, I don’t know if it’s still true or not—but you’d maketen investments and might only have one failure. Then you’d have two orthree that were maybe sold and made a little money. Then you had the one ortwo that made all the money. In between you might have the living dead. Thecompanies that go on for ten, fifteen years. They were lucky enough to get toself-sustaining capital so they didn’t have to raise more money, but they didn’treally grow, never went public. So really it’s only two or three companies outof ten that really do all the work.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: People accept that that’s just what happens.Myers: Yes, exactly right. You’d like to change the odds, but it just doesn’t work thatway usually.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, you said something just now that reminded me of a statement you madeearlier, that the IPO, rather than an acquisition, is the way to go as far as theventure capitalist is concerned, because of making more money. Could youexplain that?Myers: Well, it’s a function of the times. So in the eighties and nineties, particularlythe nineties, the public market was paying very high prices, and thetechnology companies weren’t paying when they acquired companies. Theyjust wouldn’t pay as high a price, for whatever reason. Today, with no publicmarket, you can’t do that, and so the main exit strategy is through acquisition.I’m told that companies are paying pretty high prices. It’s so competitivetoday, the time-to-market window is so short, that if they need a technology—they don’t have time to develop it themselves, they need to acquire it, and it’sworth it to pay a high price. So that’s the main exit strategy today. So it sort ofdepends on where the markets are which way works better, but traditionallypublic has been the better way.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: It seems a puzzle to me to say that time to market is shorter. I would think thatwould be very contingent on the technology that you’re talking about.Myers: Yes, but all the cycles are just going faster.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Everything is revved up.Myers: Everything is revved up. Well, everything is more competitive, not on aventure capital, but on a technology market. I have to sort of think—I’m outof the current loop. Our early premise I said was unique technologies. Only afew people in the world knew how to do it, and if you made this product work, you wouldn’t have competition for a year or two or three. And today that justdoesn’t happen. I don’t know of anything that has those conditions. So youhave competition in six months or three months, and so you’ve got to get thatproduct on the market. You’ve got to execute. You’ve got to be successful atit. And that’s true for the big companies and small companies across theboard.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is biotech perhaps an exception? Considering all the stages that a potentialproduct has to go through—clinical trials, the FDA, and all of that—doesventure capital just put biotech in a slightly different category?Myers: Yes. It’s just different dynamics. We had three people here in biotech. Iwasn’t involved with much biotech at all. So all my comments are electroniccomments, because biotech is a different world.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That’s fair.Myers: But you’re right. It takes an enormous amount of capital, far more. Thetechnology risks are far, far greater. They take longer to resolve, hugeamounts of capital. I was just talking to a biotech friend, and he’s been doingbiotech for fifteen years and he said, “I’ve had it. It just takes too long.” He’sdoing devices now, which are more akin to electronics. They have some FDAapprovals, but they don’t have all the human stuff involved in it.He likes devices because they’re more tangible. Now traditionally theyhaven’t gotten as good a multiple, as good a price on devices. Maybe that’schanged today. I don’t really know. And then the pharmaceutical companieshave no research going on, I’m told. So everybody is just looking to be boughtby a pharma company for a new product or some new technology. Grant Heidrich led that group here, and Grant did a really, really good job. Hedidn’t join us until I think ’82, but in a biotech way, he would be certainly oneof the earliest people around. Genentech was earlier. But as a venturecapitalist, Grant was really good, and he got recognized as Mayfield havingone of the best biotech track records of anybody up until at least the latenineties, including Kleiner Perkins, in terms of their number of companies andquality. Grant would be a great historian on that, and he still remains prettyactive in a number of companies.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: I definitely want to talk to him.Myers: He would be good to cover that side. 60<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, is that enough on venture capital?Myers: [laughter] Sure!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: We’re running out of time, and I don’t want to leave out this communitywork. To make sure that we get it in, start with the Entrepreneurs Foundation?Myers: Okay.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How did the idea came to you, and how did you set up the foundation, andwere you using a model of some kind?Myers: OWell, this was early ’98, and I had announced to Mayfield that I was goingto transition out but anticipated spending three-quarters time or something forthe next few years. But I also, as I said earlier, was tired of the business, readyto leave, and falling asleep in meetings. So my very simple thought was, itseemed to me, we were having very successful IPOs. So the entrepreneurs andventure capitalists wake up the next morning, and they’d made millions ofdollars. It’s magic. [laughter] So why can’t that magic work for thecommunity? So I started off with just the simple thought that what if some small piece oftheir stock in these IPOs or these companies were given to the community,and then they benefit? And that’s when I talked to Peter [deCourcy] Hero whowas running Silicon Valley Community Foundation and Sterling Speirn whowas running the Peninsula Community Foundation, a number of friends. Itwas Kirk [O.] Hanson, another friend, who said, “Well, that’s important.Money’s always important, but the real thing is we’ve got to change theculture. If you don’t change the culture of the Valley, nothing’s going to reallychange.” And at that time there was nothing happening. Hewlett-Packard and a fewcompanies contributed to the Valley, but not much activity. And even thosepeople making money, at least in my observation it was, [they’d] start a newcompany, and they would get around to the community later. So anyway, I spent a year working on this idea and evolving it. The verysimple concept is that we’d take a small amount of stock in a company. Also,we have a program to change the culture and incorporate the community aspart of the culture of the company. And so both together would make both astronger company and a stronger community.  I worked on that here, and Mayfield was very nice. I was doing almost noMayfield work, but I had an office and a secretary and a nice place to look at.I worked on that here for a long time. We hired our first executive director,Patty Burness, and Mayfield paid for that. I think that’s about the time thatMayfield set up a foundation. Actually I should come back to that. And soPatty and I began to work on this, and it was a pretty new idea. A lot ofcompanies didn’t think this was the right thing to do. So we started off withMayfield companies, and with the six Mayfield companies it was kind of abeta test site to see if I could sell this thing. And we got them going on it. Andthat’s sort of how it got started. But the fundamental thing was that this whole community—venturecapitalists, entrepreneurs in large companies, were doing nothing for the localcommunity at all, almost nothing. They might be supporting their kids’schools, but even kids’ schools— I went to help kids’ schools raise money,and people that I knew that had a lot said, “Well, why should I give money tothe school? They charge tuition. What else is there?” So it was unlike the EastCoast, which is very oriented toward supporting schools, these entrepreneursout here had no clue, and it wasn’t part of their culture; it wasn’t part of theirupbringing apparently. It was like, “What’s this?”<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Do you think some of your motivation is because you had grown up outsidethe Bay Area, and you saw that businesses had more community spirit?Myers: Well, I saw it peripherally. I grew up in St. Louis. My family was a middleincome family, but we made church contributions. So no, I didn’t grow upwith that environment. I don’t know why it is. It’s almost like I went intoventure capital, and I don’t quite know why. I don’t know quite why I did this,but as I got into it I felt completely compelled to do it. Just like this issomething that has to happen. I started the foundation as a nonprofit. Mayfieldput the initial capital in it. We had offices downstairs, but I worked harderduring that three years than I’ve ever worked in my life. Much harder.Obviously more like an entrepreneur. I’ve always felt the venture capitalistshad it easy. Entrepreneurs do all the hard work, and venture capitalists takecredit for it sometimes. Anyway, so that was how it got started.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: How were you working hard? Did this mean going around and trying to sellyour idea to specific companies?Myers: Well, it took a surprisingly long time to get the idea refined, so you could talkabout it—and talk about it in a convincing way that people would say, “Ohyes, that really makes sense.” And it seems so simple today, and we’re havingour tenth anniversary on Wednesday. <|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, spell it out a little. As I understand it, you’re talking about companiesthat have not gone public yet and are offering a percentage of their privatestock.Myers: The idea started—it was just that—to take fairly early stage companies; wewere shooting for 1 percent of the stock, which turned out to be outrageouslytoo much. But we would get a ¼ percent or a ½ percent. It would come out ofthe employee stock option pool which, when it worked, was generally okaybecause the pool was large enough, or the board would refresh the pool tomake up for what little bit we took. So it didn’t impact employees. It wasn’t asif it came out of the employees’ side. So we’d take that, and the initial version was that that stock would all comeinside Entrepreneurs Foundation. We’d help with our community programsand the rest, and then when they went public and the stock became liquid, wewould use part of it to fund our operations. But then the majority of it we’dmake a grant back to the community, and so we’d support schools or othercommunity organizations.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: The foundation made the decision of who was supported?Myers: Exactly right. I don’t know how much detail you want. The thinking therewas, the companies were too busy; they didn’t want to bother with grantmaking and all that. So we would support the community by doing this, andthen later, obviously, or at the same time, we were helping the company todevelop volunteer programs and integrate with the community. We’d helpthem find an organization that was nearby that they could work with, maybethey’d like to volunteer with. They’d help them raise money, maybe go ontheir board. So we were doing the whole cultural thing along the way. Whenthey went public, then we had the stock. At one point we had almost $10 million of stock from all these IPOs, but itwas a flawed strategy. First of all, the companies—they saw that as theirstock. [chuckling]. It’s like, “Why do we give it to you?” And so prettyquickly we changed to fifty-fifty. So 50 percent of what you give us—yougive us the whole thing, but when you go public, 50 percent will be put into adonor-advised fund with a community foundation so you can then direct thatmoney where you want. The other 50 percent will support our operations. Andthat flew pretty well for a while. But even then we were doing grant making, it turns out, obviously inhindsight, but grant making in doing our cultural thing, our two differentbusinesses, totally. And there was a rationale that you could talk about, but theboard was confused, and some people liked the grant making; some people liked the change the culture and like—but what are we doing? So when themarket collapsed in 2000, a lot of our stock was somewhat illiquid—itbasically went away, so we were out of money. So we’d made some grants and that’s a whole different story, to a venturefund grant. We’d done some of that. But the market went down, the moneywent away, pffftt, let’s get rid of that. So we got rid of the grant makingtotally and have since focused on building the company part of it. And we stillwent, for many years, with a model of 50 percent. The story gets morecomplicated. When talking to pre-public companies, we’re up to about 180companies that have joined over the years.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: All local?Myers: A hundred and eighty local companies, and we’ve probably returned, I don’tknow—$5 [million], $10 million back to the community from the stock fromthose companies. At the same time, places in other parts of the country and theworld thought this was a pretty good idea. So an Entrepreneurs Foundationwas started in Austin, Dallas, Atlanta, Boston, Denver, Seattle, Oregon, andIsrael. Now each of these were started using our concept, and at first we began tolicense them to use the name, and this and that, but we ran out of time and wedidn’t have any resources, to speak of. So they each have a slight variation onthe theme, but they’re pretty close. We’ve tried to be helpful, but as I said, wedidn’t have the resources. So we’re kind of the mother ship, but we haven’tdone much. There are over 700 companies that have joined an EntrepreneursFoundation; there’s $10 [million] or $15 million gone back to the community,and hundreds of thousands of employees have—I don’t know what thenumber is now—have participated in our volunteer programs.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That’s pretty impressive. Over what time period?Myers: Ten years ago. It started in January of ’98.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: That’s fabulous.Myers: But then how it has evolved is that it continued to be too hard. My originaldream was that we’d reach a tipping point where people would say, “Youknow, this is such a great thing for everybody. It’s good for the company; it’sgood for the community. Everybody should be doing it. So the way we all dobusiness in Silicon Valley is to join the Entrepreneurs Foundation, and every lawyer, every venture capitalist, would just expect that of their company totake a sliver of stock and do these things. That’s where I wanted to get; we didn’t get there. It proved continually toohard to sell to the companies in several regards. Many CEOs liked it; I wouldsay most CEOs thought it was a really cool idea. But to get that stock they hadto go to the board of directors. Going to a board of directors is terrifying formost executives—I shouldn’t say terrifying—they have a lot of agenda itemsand things they want to get through the board, and so they are very carefulhow they manage their board. And getting stock for a fuzzy thing like thecommunity is like really low on the list. So what would happen is they would not make the agenda, “Oh, you know,we just had too many things. We didn’t get to do it. So next meeting, nextmeeting we can do it again.” Or an entrepreneur would bring it up and say,“This is something that we’d like to talk to you about and get a little sliver ofstock.” And there’d be some venture capitalist on the board that said, “This isstupid. We’re not going to do this.” Well, when someone says that on a lowpriority item, nobody’s going to fight for it. The CEO’s not going to go to bat. So for the period of time I was running all this, I knew a lot of the boardmembers. I’d call every board member; I’d go to the board meeting. You justkill yourself. I’d get everybody lined up behind this to say, “Okay, we’ll doit.” But then when I stopped running it, and we have a great person running itthat has been there for ten years, but she isn’t a venture capitalist that knowsall these people. She kind of does now, but nevertheless, she can’t go to aventure capitalist partner meeting and go to parties and say, “Brook—whydidn’t you do this? You’ve got to be in this thing. Tomorrow when you vote, Iwant you to back this thing!” And so we worked like crazy over the years to get more and more support.We’ve got a council of venture capitalists. There are about sixty venturecapitalists that have all signed up, helping us find other companies. Diane[Solinger] has done a great job of organizing volunteer groups. And we haveattorneys that back it; we have attorneys that put us in term sheets. We havedone all this stuff. But it’s still so hard. So we evolved just a few years ago to say on the stock thing, “We really don’tneed much stock. Let’s think about emulating the Google Foundation and theeBay Foundation. We actually will help you set up your foundation and we’lldo the volunteer work.” So at least on the stock, it didn’t look like they weregiving the stock to us. And that was helpful for a while, but it’s still so hard.We’re going to be announcing the night after tomorrow where we are. Whatwe have been experimenting with for the last year is that we’ve become,probably, the repository of corporate/community knowledge, better thananybody else in the world, probably. We are really good at it, the team. We have twenty ways you can do it; we know how to implement it; we know thelegal issues; we know all about how to do it. And so, what’s been happening is we’ve been involved in more and moremature companies, clearly ones that are pre-public, we try to go there and getthat stock when we can, but now we’re going to larger companies that arealready up and running. They don’t give us stock, they just pay a fee, but wework with their HR [Human Resources] groups. So in those companies theymight have a little bit going, or nothing, but they know that—they have moretime, they’re larger companies, the HR knows this, so they’re coming to usnow and saying, “How do we get this started? How do we get this kind ofprogram going? How do we do a school program?” Or, “How do we do paidvacation days off?” And so we now have these larger companies are startingto join us. We’ve put together a group, conferences of this group, and now we’re juststarting a new whole Web service where we’ll reach out all over the countryto hundreds of companies in terms of sharing what we know about corporate/community arrangements, how to make it work. So it’s evolving. I think in some respects it didn’t get as far as I would haveliked, but it’s done pretty darn well. And I think, appropriately, we’re movinginto a new phase I think actually will be pretty neat.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: A hundred and eighty companies! I think that speaks for itself. [chuckling]Myers: Yes, that’s pretty good, yes, that’s pretty good.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Shall we then talk about the Mayfield Foundation? Which you think wasfounded around the same time?Myers: Around the same time. This was also a time frame with all the companiesgoing public—you’ve probably read about this. If you were friends with abroker at a Robertson Stephens or one of the hot investment banks, the brokerwould get an allocation of this hot IPO stock. And so they’d say to you, “Doyou want 100 shares of this stock? It’s really hot!” And so, “Great, thanks.”And you’d buy the stock on the opening, it would double or triple, and you’dsell it an hour later or the next day. And you’d made three times your money. So as part of their marketing, they would go to venture capitalists and say,“Do you want this stock?” And some venture capitalists would put upthousands and tens of thousands and buy a lot of stock and then flip it the nextday or a couple of days later and they’d make $10,000, $100,000, $1 million dollars in a day or two! And then it got to be where you wouldn’t put up anymoney. It all happened so fast no money changed hands. Pretty neat! We thought that wasn’t really a good idea. So from the beginning we feltthat—it wasn’t dishonest, but it just wasn’t they way it’s supposed to be. Sowe would get these allocations of stock, like everybody else, particularly ifone of our companies— We had another variation: if one of your owncompanies is going public, or you’re on the board, then you’d be given a bigallocation for your firm to use in this way and make all this extra money. Andthat’s part of their marketing. So that’s when we set up a foundation. We said, “Well, we don’t want to playthat game.” So we’d take that stock; we’d put it in our foundation. And thenwhen it would go up we’d liquidate it in the foundation. So our foundationhad many millions of dollars in it from all this free stock we got, and thenwe’d use that. We began to do community programs. And so we had acommittee here and we’d make grants, and like anything, it was sort of hard toget it all going, but many years we made grants of $0.5 million or $1 million,the end of the year, to local community organizations. Then that foundation also started to fund Entrepreneurs Foundation in termsof hiring our first executive director. We had to rent more office space and wehired another person. In fact, Diane Solinger, who runs it now was hired backthen. So anyway, the foundation was used to do that. I’m not aware, and itmight not be true, but I’m not aware of any other venture capitalists that didthat. But I thought it was pretty cool. And then we actually set up giving groups, where among the partners whowere then starting to do philanthropy in their own way. It’s always an issue—what do you support. Everybody’s busy; they don’t have time to go look forthings. So I started this thing saying, “Well, if Yogen [Dalal] or Kevin orsomebody else is involved with something, maybe we ought to just supportwhat they’re involved in,” kind of thing. So we set up monthly meetings. So ifone of the partners was involved in something, which meant on the board, thepartners would all come to the dinner, and the respective nonprofit wouldcome and make a pitch. The idea was everybody would pitch in—I forgotwhat—but they would walk away from the meeting with $100,000. And wedid that for many months. That was pretty cool. That wasn’t the foundation;that was personal money. But just—support each other’s programs. And reallycool. Our CFO at the time, George Pavlov, his wife had a baby at Stanford, endedup having a really unique kidney disease, and Stanford didn’t have a massspectrometer department to test for it. And it took almost a week to get the testdone. The baby almost died, and if they’d gotten the test, they could haveknown right away what the issue was. It was a very obscure thing, and therewas only one place in the U.S. or California. So George decided to help set up that department. So he raised, among us, the first 0.25 million dollars to getthe department going. And then the foundation I think—various thingshappened. Well now, it’s a full-fledged department, staffed, funded, atStanford, doing unique diseases that they never tested for before. And Georgestarted this whole thing, got it going, and the foundation started it. So anyway,I just thought that unique among venture capitalists for sure, were some of thethings we were doing at that time.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Impressive. Another thing, I read that you were chairman of Stanford’sVenture Investment Group.Myers: Was I? Oh I know—there were several of them. The Engineering School hada venture investment group—they got venture capitalists. I was chairman ofthe Stanford Business School one. There’s another one at the EngineeringSchool. The concept—brilliant concept on Stanford’s part—was, “Let’s get abunch of venture capitalists to all be on this little team, and so wheneverthey’re doing a deal, you can have Stanford’s money. So Stanford’sendowment can invest whatever you’ll let in—$0.25 million, $1 million,whatever you want. No questions asked. If you want the money, it’s there.”And it was brilliant. [chuckling] So they got the best venture capitalists in theValley, that cared about Stanford. So we’re raising $10 million, and we’vejust allocated $1 million for Stanford. They didn’t get it every time, but lots oftimes. Stanford made gajillions on that. That was in the boom time. Stanfordsold a lot of those stocks when they went public—it was just a brill[iant].<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: This is the nineties too?Myers: The late nineties, 2000. So I chaired the business school one doing the samething for a number of years. Right. I forgot all about that.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Is that now just a common appurtenance?Myers: I don’t know if it even continued. I kind of doubt it because the deals got socompetitive that I think at the end, you couldn’t get Stanford in. Venturecapitalists said, “I want $2 million or nothing.” And so you couldn’t pry themback and get Stanford in. So I think it deteriorated at the end of the boomcycle, and I don’t know what’s happened today, if it’s still going on. They hadone for the athletic fund; they had two or three of these going. Berkeley triedto get one going, but it was too late. I don’t know if they did or not. It was agreat thing.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well. I’m now at the end of my questions. Myers: Okay, good! [laughter]<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Now, it’s your turn!Myers: My turn! I don’t have any questions!<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: What should we talk about that we haven’t talked about?Myers: I don’t know! [chuckling] You’ve been good with all your questions.You’vecovered a lot, I guess. I hope it’s helpful.<|endoftext|>
Interviewer: Well, I can’t thank you enough. You were extremely articulate, and I learned alot.Myers: Well, you’re welcome.
